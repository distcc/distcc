This is a perfectly ordinary copy of libpopt 1.7, except that the
configure scripts have been munged to make them fit with distcc.  NLS
support has been removed, because distcc currently does not use it.

It is only used on platforms that do not have a sufficiently
up-to-date copy of their own.  If you build distcc on a platform which
has popt, this directory should not be used.  (You can control that
using the --with-included-popt configure flag.)

popt has no apparent home page, but the source can be retrieved from

ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist/rpm-4.1.x
