    # Create summary graph with structure A -> B -> C -> B and B -> D -> C' ->

    # /curr (for all nodes). The include graph is made for a searchlist [src, /,
    # /dirlink].  Note that the first directory in the searchlist is relative.
    # For simplicity, we consider angled resolution only. Here is a description
    # of the nodes.
    #
    #  - Nodes A, B correspond to includepaths a.h and b.h, which are relatively
    #    resolved because they are found in src, which means absolute
    #    directory /curr/src.  These filepaths are thus resolved to src/a.h and
    #    src/b.h and their corresponding realpaths are /curr/src/a.h and
    #    /curr/src/b.h.  The realpaths are all what is recorded in the include
    #    closure, because the files are relatively resolved.
    #
    #  - Nodes C, C', and E are absolutely resolved includepaths. More
    #    specifically:
    #
    #     - Nodes C and C' correspond to includepath dir/c.h and c.h, which
    #       during resolution were found in / and /dirlink, respectively.
    #       However, /dirlink is a symbolic link to /dir, which is a real
    #       directory, so C and C' in fact correspond to the same realpath
    #       namely /dir/c.h.
    #
    #    - Node E corresponds to includepath dir/e.h and was found during
    #      resolution to be in /. So, the realpath of this node is /dir/e.h.
    #
    #  - Node D is a dummy and it is not recorded in the include closure. Still,
    #    its non-dummy descendants are recorded.
