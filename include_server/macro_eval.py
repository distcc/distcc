"""Evaluation of macros acccording to an overapproximation semantics.

This module generally follows CPP semantics for the evalution of macros. But we
treat every define as a possible one, because we don't know whether it is
actually executed when a file is really preprocessed. Our semantics is thus
multi-valued: an expression (that is, a string) is evaluated to the set of
poosible values it can have according to arbitrary choices of #defines in effect
among those encountered in the program text.

An example explains the general idea. If we have:

#define A x
#define A y
#define B 1
#define B 2

Then the expression

  A.B

evaluates to one of the following:

  x.1
  y.1
  x.2
  y.2

The set {"x.1", "y.1", "x.2", "y.2"} is the value of EvalExpr("A.B",
symbol_table), where symbol_table is the dictionary in which we have
stored the four #define's.

Currently, we will be satisfied with

  A A

evaluating to

  x x
  x y
  y x
  y y

although a sharper semantic modelling would yield only:

  x x
  y y



How to Read This Code
---------------------
An understanding of the C preprocessor is necessary. See "The GNU C Preprocessor
Internals" (http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cppinternals). Especially the section
"Macro Expansion Algorithm" is informative.

Whitespace Insertion and Other Deficiencies
-------------------------------------------
CPP inserts whitespaces and sometimes doesn't according to very complicated
rules. We do not insert whitespaces.

Also, we retokenize each intermediate expansion.

For actual arguments of macros, we also we do not do the right thing for
parentheses inside single quotes, which is to ignore them.

There are probably several more deviations from CPP semantics.

These deviations should not matter for most common included computes.

What If the Include Processor is Wrong
--------------------------------------
Assume that we have

  #include very_complicated_call(anfhis,fifj)

If the include processor produces spurious expansions like:

 "whatda.c"
 2 + 2
 "5 * 3"

then file whada.c if found in search directory becomes part of the include
closure. So does the file "5 * 3". But 2 + 2 does not have the shape of an a
filepath in an include: the filepath must be in quotes or angle brackets.

These spurious files are not harmful to preprocessing on the server.

If the include server omits calculating the expansion

 "right_file.h"

then the compilation on the server will fail. The client, according to the logic
of dcc_build_somewhere, will then perform a local compilation.

Symbol Table
------------

The symbol table is a dictionary, whose entries are of the form 

  symbol: definition_list

Each definition in definition_list is either
 - a string, denoting the expansion of an object-like macro, or
 - a pair ([param_1,...,param_n], rhs), which denotes a function-like macro,
   whose formal parameters are param_1,.., param_n and whose expansion is rhs,
   before the substitution of formal parameters for actual parameters.
