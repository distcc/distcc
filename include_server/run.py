USAGE="""Usage: run.py [--install] CMD [ARG...]

Option:

 --run_in_install:  find extension module under lib of installation directory

Locate a Python extension module in some directory D under the
c_extensions/build subdirectory of the directory that contains the present
command. With --run_in_install, assume that this script resides in an installed
version; this means that the directory structure is different and D is located
as ../../lib.

Then run CMD [ARG...] with environment variable PYTHONPATH augmented with D.

Normally, print out a message where the extension module is found. But, with
--run_in_install this message is suppressed.

Examples:

From anywhere:
  # Start include server.
  /home/distcc/include_server/run.py include_server.py
  
In the include_server directory:
  # Run include_server tests.
  ./run.py include_server_test.py
  # Pycheck include_server.
  ./run.py `which pychecker` include_server.py  

In installed distcc-pump:
   # See 'pump' script.
   $include_server_location/run.py --run_in_install include_server.py ..
