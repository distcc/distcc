"""Divination of built-in system directories used by compiler installation.

It is undesirable for the distcc-pump to send header files that reside
under the built-in search path.  In a correct compiler installation,
these files must already be present on the server. This module lets
the distcc-pump run the compiler in a special mode that allows the
built-in system directories to be revealed.

The current code is tested only for gcc 4.1.1.

TODO(klarlund) Find out what other versions this code works for.
TODO(klarlund) The include server halts if the built-in system
directories cannot be determined. Should this be improved upon?

class CompilerDefaults(object):
  """Records and caches the default search dirs and creates symlink farm.

  This function works only for gcc, and only some versions at that,
  because we parse the output from gcc to determine the default search dirs.

  The 'default' searchdirs are those on the search-path that are built in, that
  is known to the preprocessor, as opposed to being set on the commandline via
  -I et al.

  When we pass an option such as -I/foo/bar to the server,
  the server will rewrite it to say -I/server/path/root/foo/bar,
  where /server/path/root is the temporary directory on the server
  that corresponds to root on the client (e.g. typically /dev/shm/distccd_nnn).
  This causes problems in this case of -I options such as -I/usr/include/foo,
  where the path contains a 'default' search directory (in this case
  /usr/include) as a prefix.
  Header files under the system default directories are assumed to exist
  on the server, and it would be expensive to send them to the server
  unnecessarily (we measured it, and it slowed down the build of Samba by 20%).
  So for -I options like -I/usr/include/foo, we want the server
  to use /usr/include/foo on the server, not /server/path/root/usr/include/foo.

  Because the server unconditionally rewrites include search
  paths on the command line to be relative to the server root, we must take
  corrective action when identifying default system dirs: references to files
  under these relocated system directories must be redirected to the absolute
  location where they're actually found.

  To do so, we create a symlink forest under client_root.
  This will contain symlinks of the form

    usr/include -> ../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/include

  After being sent to the server, the server will rewrite them as

    /server/path/root/usr/include ->
       /server/path/root/../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/include

  which will make

     /server/path/root/usr/include

  become a symlink to

     /usr/include

  Consequently, an include search directory such as -I /usr/include/foo will
  work on the server, even after it has been rewritten to:

    -I /server/path/root/usr/include/foo
