    Arguments:

      filepath_real: the realpath_map index corresponding to
        filepath_resolved_pair
    Returns:
      include_closure: a dictionary.

    The include_closure consists of entries of the form

        realpath_idx: [(searchdir_idx_1, includepath_idx_1),
                       (searchdir_idx_2, includepath_idx_2), ...]

    where searchdir_i is an absolute path.  realpath_idx is a realpath
    index corresponding to a single #include (more exactly, it's the
    index of the path that the #include resolves to).
    
    This include closure calculation omits any system header files,
    that is, header files found in a systemdir (recall systemdirs are
    those searchdirs that are built into the preprocessor, such as
    "/usr/include").  It concentrates only on header files users might
    edit.

    The keys are the most important part of the include_closure; the
    values are used only to munge the preprocessor output to give more
    useful filenames via the #line directive.  The issue here is that
    source files in the distcc system are not in their "proper"
    locations: for instance, /usr/X11R6/include/X11.h might be in
    /tmp/distcc/usr/X11R6/include/X11.h rather than in
    /usr/X11R6/include.

    As the example above suggests, relative position of .h files is
    preserved in distcc-land, so if the #include ends up being a
    relative include, we do not need to do any munging, so we don't
    bother to store anything in the value-list corresponding to
    realpath_idx.  If, however, the #include ends up being an absolute
    include, we do store the "real" name (as an index-pair) in the
    list.  For debugging purposes, we may store more than one "real"
    name if there are several, which can happen when multiple symlinks
    point to the same place.
    TODO(csilvers): change the code to only store one.

    Here's a concrete example: suppose we're trying to resolve
    #include "bar.h", and the searchdir_list is ["reldir/foo",
    "/usr/foo"].  If "<cwd>/reldir/foo/bar.h" exists, then
    realpath_idx will resolve to that, and the preprocessor will emit
    code like "#line 1 reldir/foo/bar.h".  That's correct as-is, no
    munging needed, so we don't bother to put a value in the
    include_closure entry for this realpath.

    If, however, "<cwd>/reldir/foo/bar.h" does not exist, but
    "/usr/foo/bar.h" exists, then realpath_idx will resolve to that,
    and the preprocessor will emit code like "#line 1
    /tmp/distcc/usr/foo/bar.h".  We'll want to munge that to be
    "/usr/foo/bar.h", so we do put a value in the include_closure
    entry for this realpath, to tell us what to munge to.

    (Note we *could* use realpath to tell us the "real" filename,
    without needing a separate index-pair, but that's not as
    user-friendly, since realpath is the filename after symlinks are
    resolved.  Thus, on some setups the realpath of /usr/foo/bar.h
    could be /netapp1/mnt/foo/bar.h or something equally unhelpful.)

    This method to be overridden by derived class.
