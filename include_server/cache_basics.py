"""Classes enabling definition and composition of caches.

This file defines caches used to speed up the does-this-file-exist
test that forms the basis of the C preprocessor's include-file
handling, and takes most of its time.

When the preprocessor sees a line like "#include <foo/bar.h>" it looks
for a file named "bar.h" in many directories: /usr/include/foo/bar.h,
./foo/bar.h, and so forth.  More precisely, the preprocessor is given
a "search path", which is a list of directory-names.  (By default, the
search-path looks like ['/usr/include', '/usr/local/include', ...],
but it's often extended via gcc flags like -I, -isystem, -iprefix,
etc.)  To resolve a single #include like "#include <foo/bar.h>", the
preprocessor goes through every directory in the search path, running

   os.stat(os.path.join(current_working_dir, search_dir, 'foo/bar.h'))

until the stat call succeeds.  With dozens of search-dirs to look
through, dozens of #include lines per source file, and hundreds of
source files per compilation, this can add up to millions of stat
calls.  Many of these calls are exactly the same, so caching is a big
win.

The cache of stat calls takes a filename as input and produces a bool
as output, saying if the filename exists.  For reasons that will
become clear in a moment, we actually represent the input filename as
a triple that breaks the filename into its three components:

   1) currdir: the current working directory (usually os.path.absdir('.'))
   2) searchdir: an element of the search path (eg '/usr/include', 'base')
   3) includepath: the thing that comes after "#include" in source files
                   ("foo/bar.h" in our examples above).

Why do we break the input into three parts?  Consider what cache-lookups
we have to do for a single source file:
   cache[os.path.join(currdir, searchdir1, includepath1)]   # #include <ipath1>
   cache[os.path.join(currdir, searchdir2, includepath1)]   # #include <ipath1>
   cache[os.path.join(currdir, searchdir3, includepath1)]   # #include <ipath1>
   [etc...until the cache-lookup returns True]
   cache[os.path.join(currdir, searchdir1, includepath2)]   # #include <ipath2>
   cache[os.path.join(currdir, searchdir2, includepath2)]   # #include <ipath2>
   cache[os.path.join(currdir, searchdir3, includepath2)]   # #include <ipath2>
   [etc]

By having the key be a triple, we avoid all those unnecessary
os.path.join calls.  But even if we do this, we notice bigger fish
to fry: the Python interpreter still has to do a string-hash of
currdir for every lookup, and also has to string-hash searchdirX and
includepathX many times.  It would be much more efficient if we did
those hashes ourselves, reducing the number of string-hashes from
O(|search-path| * |#include lines|) to
O(|search-path| + |#include lines|).

This motivates (finally!) the data structures in this file.  We have
three string-to-number maps, for mapping each currdir, searchdir, and
includepath to a small integer.  We put that all together in a cache,
that takes a triple of integers as its key and produces True if the
file exists, False if it does not, or None if its status is unknown.

The String-to-number Map(s)
---------------------------
The basic map that converts a filepath-path -- a currdir, searchdir,
or includepath -- to a small integer is called MapToIndex.  MapToIndex
provides mapping in both directions:
   index: a dictionary mapping paths (strings) to indices in 1..N, and
   string: an array of size N + 1 that implements the reverse mapping

So:
   obj.string[obj.index[path_as_string]] == path_as_string
   obj.index[obj.string[path_as_number]] == path_as_number

Note we map from 1..N, and not 0..N-1, which leave us 0 free to use as
a synonym for None or False.

There are also classes that specialize MapToIndex for specific purposes.

DirectoryMapToIndex assumes the input is a directory, and in
particular a directory that does not have a slash at the end of it (eg
"/etc").  It adds the trailing slash before inserting into the map.
This is useful because it allows us to use + to join this directory
with a relative filename, rather than the slower os.path.join().

RelpathMapToIndex assumes the input is a relative filepath, that is,
one that does not start with /.  When combined with DirectoryMapToIndex
entries, + can be used as a fast alternative to os.path.join().

CanonicalMapToIndex is a MapToIndex that canonializes its input before
inserting it into the map: resolving symlinks, getting rid of ..'s,
etc.  It takes an absolute path as input.

Other Caches
------------
Besides the maps from strings to integers, there are three other caches.
One is the realpath-cache, that takes a filename and returns
os.path.realpath(filename).  We cache this because os.path.realpath()
is very slow.  This is called CanonicalPath.

The second cache, the DirnameCache, maps an arbitrary pathname to
dirname(pathname), that is, the directory the pathname is in.  The
input pathname is represented by a (currdir_idx, searchdir_idx,
includepath_idx) triple.  The output is likewise represented as a
number: an index into the DirectoryMapToIndex structure.

The third cache is called SystemdirPrefixCache.  It tells you, for a
given absolute filepath, whether it is prefixed by a systemdir (that
is, one of the searchdirs that's built into cpp, such as /usr/include).
This is useful to cache because there are several systemdirs, and it's
expensive to check them all each time.

Naming Conventions
------------------
  currdir: the current working dir.
  searchdir: an element of the search-path (places cpp looks for .h files).
  includepath: the string a source file #includes.
  realpath: a full filepath with all its symlinks resolved:
     os.path.realpath(os.path.join(currdir, searchdir, includepath))
  FOO_idx: the small integer associated with the string FOO.

  includepath_map: the map that takes includepaths to their idx and back
     (a RelpathMapToIndex).
  directory_map: the map that takes currdirs and searchdirs to their
     idx and back.  It also is used to store dirname(filepath) for arbitrary
     filepaths -- basically, anything we know is a directory (a
     DirectoryMapToIndex).
  realpath_map: the map that takes full filepaths to their idx and back,
     canonicalizing them first (by resolving symlinks) (a
     CanonicalMapToIndex).

  searchlist: a list of searchdirs.  In gcc/cpp documentation, this is
     called the "search path", but for consistency, in this code we reserve
     the name "path" to mean "filesystem component," never "list of dirs".
     (A list of strings).
  systemdir: a searchdir that's built into cpp, rather than set via -I.
     (A string.)

  resolved_filepath: given an includepath, and a (possibly implicit)
     currdir and searchlist, the resolved_filepath is
        os.path.join(currdir, searchdir, includepath)
     for the first searchdir in searchlist for which the joined string
     exists.  This path can be represented in many ways: 1) a string like
     "foo/bar/baz.h" (if so, this string has been canonicalized to resolve
     symlinks and the like); 2) an index into realpath_map associated with
     that string; 3) a triple of indices; or 4) a pair of indices plus an
     assumption that os.getcwd() == currdir.

Pair Represenation of Filepaths
-------------------------------
A file is uniquely determined by the triple
   (currdir_idx, searchdir_idx, includepath_idx)
For a single compilation unit, the code will often start with a
chdir(currdir).  After that, we often refer to a file by the pair
   (searchdir_idx, includepath_idx)
which might be either an absolute filename or relative to $PWD.

We refer to this pair as a filepath_pair.
TODO(csilvers): find a better name?

The function IsFilepathPair(x) tests whether x is a pair that could
plausibly have a searchdir_idx as its first element and an
includepath_idx as its second.

Tests
-----
This code is currently only tested by regression tests of modules
using this one.

  The hash table is three-level structure:
   - build_stat[currdir_idx] contains an array for each includepath_idx
   - build_stat[currdir_idx][includepath_idx] is this array, and
   - build_stat[currdir_idx][includepath_idx][searchdir_idx] is either
      * False if os.path.join(currdir, searchdir, includepath) does not exist
      * True if it does
      * None when it is not known whether it exists or not
  In addition, we keep a parallel structure for the realpath, that lets us
  quickly map from a filepath to os.path.realpath(filepath).
   - real_stat[currdir_idx] contains an array for each fp
   - real_stat[currdir_idx][includepath_idx] is this array, and
   - real_stat[currdir_idx][includepath_idx][searchdir_idx] is either
      * realpath_idx, such that realpath_map.string[realpath_idx] =
           os.path.realpath(os.path.join(currdir, searchdir, includepath))
        when build_stat[currdir_idx][includepath_idx][searchdir_idx] = True
