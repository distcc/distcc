/*
 * Utilities for dealing with argv[]-style strings.
 *
 * These rules might not yet be consistently applied in distcc, but they
 * should be in the future:
 *
 * For simplicity in managing memory we try to keep all argv structures
 * malloc'd, without any shared structure.  It is then possible to just free
 * the whole thing whenever we're finished with it.
 *
 * One exception is of course the argv used to invoke the program, which is
 * treated as read-only.
