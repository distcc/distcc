 * Does not use sendfile(), so either one may be a socket.
 *
 * In the current code at least one of the files will always be a regular
 * (disk) file, even though it may not be mmapable.  That should mean that
 * writes to it will always complete immediately.  That in turn means that on
 * each pass through the main loop we ought to either completely fill our
 * buffer, or completely drain it, depending on which one is the disk.
 *
 * In future we may put back the ability to feed the compiler from a fifo, in
 * which case it may be that the writes don't complete.
 *
 * We might try selecting on both buffers and handling whichever is ready.
 * This would require some approximation to a circular buffer though, which
 * might be more complex.
