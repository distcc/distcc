        url: the url to download the file.
        package_file: the filename of the downloaded url.  If not
           specified, taken to be basename(url).  This should rarely
           need to be specified.
           specified on the commandline to just benchmark a single project.
        name: the name used to identify the project when listing projects
           on the benchmark commandline.  If not specified, taken to be
           package_file, but with the .tar.* extension removed.
        md5: the output of 'md5sum package_file'; used to verify a download.
        unpacked_subdir: The top-level directory created when we untar the
           package_file.  If not specified, taken to be self.name, which is
           typically right (at least for projects make using autotools).
        build_subdir: the subdirectory of unpacked_subdir where building
           should be done; we create it if needed.  Defaults to '.'.
           You should only need to change this if your project does not
           have its configure script in the top-level directory.
        configure_cmd: the command to generate the project's Makefile.
           It is run in build_subdir.  Defaults to './configure'.
        pre_build_cmd: a command to run before running the build command.
           It is run in build_subdir.  Defaults to running nothing.
        build_cmd: The command to build the project from the Makefile.
           We add VAR=val arguments, so build_cmd must be a single command
           that is either a form of 'make', or takes the same style
           arguments.  Defaults to 'make'.
        include_server_args: include server tweaks such as stat reset triggers
           for builds that modify source files.
