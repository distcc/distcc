# Unlike the main distcc test suite, this program *does* require you
# to manually set up servers on your choice of machines on the
# network, and make sure that they all have appropriate compilers
# installed.  The performance measurements obviously depend on the
# network and hardware available.

# It also depends on you having the necessary dependencies to build
# the software.  If you regularly build software on Linux you should
# be OK.  Some things (the GIMP) will be harder than others.

# On some platforms, it may be impossible to build some targets -- for
# example, Linux depends on having a real-mode x86 assembler, which
# probably isn't installed on Solaris.

# Note that running this program will potentially download many
# megabytes of test data.


# TODO: Support applying patches after unpacking, before building.
# For example, they might be needed to fix -j bugs in the Makefile.

# TODO: In stats, show ratio of build time to slowest build time.  (Or
# to first one run?)

# TODO: Allow choice of which compiler and make options to use.

# TODO: Perhaps add option to do "make clean" -- this might be faster
# than unzipping and configuring every time.  But perhaps also less
# reproducible.

# TODO: Add option to run tests on different sets or orderings of
# machines.

Test distcc relative performance building different projects.

Options:

  --list-projects            show defined projects
  --cc=PATH                  specify base value of CC to pass to configure
  --cxx=PATH                 specify base value of CXX to pass to configure
  --output=FILE              print final summary to FILE in addition to stdout
  -c, --compiler=COMPILER    specify one compiler to use; format is
                             {local|dist|lzo|pump},h<NUMHOSTS>,j<NUMJOBS>
  -n N                       repeat compilation N times

                             default), only skip the download action;
                             if set to 2, do not skip any action

The C and C++ compiler versions used can be set with the --cc and --cxx
options.

Use of distcc features is set with the -c/--compiler option.  The argument
to -c/--compiler has three components, separated by commas.  The first
component specifies which distcc features to enabled: "local" means
run cc locally, "distcc" means use plain distcc, "lzo" means enabled
compression, and "pump" means to enable pump mode and compression.
The second component specifies how many distcc hosts to use.  The third
component specifies how many jobs to run (the -j/--jobs option to "make").
Multiple -c/--compiler options specify different scenarios to measure.
The default is to measure a few reasonable scenarios.
