If you find distcc useful, please take a little time to fill out this
survey and mail it to {distcc-survey at google.com}.

Don't stress too much about getting scientifically rigorous numbers:
rough numbers are more useful than none at all.  Ideally, complete the
survey for one large application that you work on, where compile speed
is important.

If after installing distcc you find that it makes your compile slower,
or not as much faster as you would be expect, then please write to
{distcc at lists.samba.org} instead of filling in the survey, and
we'll try to resolve the problem.
