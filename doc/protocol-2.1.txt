protocol
--------

Protocol 2.1 is a variation of protocol 2 and protocol 1.  It gets a new version number
because that's the simplest way to indicate the change.

The protocol number (DIST) sent by the client is set to 4.  The server
must respond (DONE) in version 4.

The content of the "bulk" tokens (DOTI, DOTO, SERR, SOUT) are
compressed using the ZSTD algorithm.

The token parameter gives the length of the compressed form.

As a special case, if the uncompressed form is zero bytes, then it is
not compressed but rather sent directly as zero bytes.  (Compression
slightly expands a zero byte string.)

The distcc client and server can handle protocol 2.1 if zstd support was
compiled in.
