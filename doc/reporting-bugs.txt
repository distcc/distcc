# How to report bugs in distcc

If you are having trouble with distcc, please open a question at
<https://github.com/distcc/distcc/discussions/categories/q-a>, or, if it's
clearly a bug, open a bug in that GitHub repo.

  * The first aim of a bug report is to let the programmer see the
    failure with their own eyes. If you can't be with them to make it
    fail in front of them, give them detailed instructions so that
    they can make it fail for themselves.

  * In case the first aim doesn't succeed, and the programmer can't
    see it failing themselves, the second aim of a bug report is to
    describe what went wrong. Describe everything in detail. State
    what you saw, and also state what you expected to see. Write down
    the error messages, especially if they have numbers in.

  * By all means try to diagnose the fault yourself if you think you
    can, but if you do, you should still report the symptoms as well.

  * Write clearly. Say what you mean, and make sure it can't be
    misinterpreted.

  * Above all, be precise.

A good bug report for distcc should include these details:

  * What version of distcc you're using, e.g. "2.7.1".  If you got it
    from a distribution package rather than building from source,
    please say so.

  * Your platform (e.g. "Red Hat 8.0", "HP-UX 11.11") and compiler
    "gcc 3.3"

  * What you're trying to do: e.g. "install distcc", "build Mozilla",
    "build my own program".

  * What went wrong: e.g. did you get an error message, did it hang,
    did it build a program that didn't work, did it not distribute
    compilation to machines that ought to get it?  You'd be surprised
    how many people don't say what actually happened.

  * If you have an example of a compiler invocation that failed, quote
    it, e.g.:

       distcc gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -D_GNU_SOURCE -I./src \
       "-DSYSCONFDIR=\"/etc/\"" -I./lzo -g -O2 -W -Wall -W \
       -Wimplicit -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-align \
       -Wwrite-strings -Waggregate-return -Wstrict-prototypes \
       -Wmissing-prototypes -Wnested-externs -o src/clirpc.o \
       -c src/clirpc.c

  * Turn on client and server error logging.  On the client, set these
    environment variables, and try to reproduce the problem:

       export DISTCC_VERBOSE=1 DISTCC_LOG=/tmp/distcc.log

    Start the server with the --verbose option.  If the problem is
    intermittent, leave logging enabled and then pull out the lines
    from the log file when the problem recurs.

  * If you got an error message on stderr, quote that error exactly.
    Find the lines in the log files pertaining to the compile, and
    include all of them in your report, by looking at the process ID
    in square brackets.  If you can't work that out, quote the last
    few hundred lines leading up to the failure.
