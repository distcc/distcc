distccd - distributed C/C++ compiler server<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_2>
SYNOPSIS</A>
</H2>
<B>distccd --daemon</B> <I> [OPTIONS]</I><BR>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_3>
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H2>
<I>distccd</I> is the server for the distcc(1) distributed compiler.
It accepts and runs compilation jobs for network clients.<BR>
<P>
distcc can run over either TCP or a connection command such as
ssh(1). TCP connections are fast but relatively insecure.  SSH
connections are secure but slower.<BR>
<P>
For SSH connections, distccd must be installed on the volunteer
but should not run as a daemon -- it will be started over SSH
as needed. SSH connections have several advantages: neither the
client nor server listens on any new ports; compilations run with
the privileges of the user that requested them; unauthorized users
cannot access the server; and source and output is protected in
transit.<BR>
<P>
For TCP connections, distccd can run either from an inetd-style
program, or as a standalone server.  Standalone mode is recommended
because it is slightly more efficient and allows distccd to regulate
the number of incoming jobs.  The <B> --listen</B> and <B> --allow</B>
options can be used for simple IP-based access control.<BR>
<P>
distcc may be started either by root or any other user.  If run
by root, it gives away privileges and changes to the user specified
by the <B> --user</B> option, or the user called &quot;distcc&quot;,
or the user called &quot;nobody&quot;.<BR>
<P>
distccd does not have a configuration file; it's behaviour is
controlled only by command-line options and requests from clients.<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_4>
STANDALONE SERVER</A>
</H2>
The recommended method for running distccd is as a standalone
server. distccd will listen for network connections and fork several
child processes to serve them.<BR>
<P>
If you installed distcc using a packaged version you may be able
to start the server using the standard mechanism for your operating
system, such as<BR>
<UL>
<P>
# service distcc start<BR>
</UL>
<P>
To start distccd as a standalone service, run a command like this
either as root or an ordinary user:<BR>
<UL>
<P>
# distccd --daemon<BR>
</UL>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_5>
RUNNING FROM INIT</A>
</H2>
distccd may be run as a standalone daemon under the control of
another program like init(8) or daemontools.  The super-server
starts distccd when the system boots, and whenever it exits.<BR>
<P>
distccd should be started just as for a standalone server, except
that the <B> --no-detach</B> option should be used so that the
super-server can monitor it.<BR>
<P>
For example, to add distccd as a process to Linux sysvinit, add
this line to <I> /etc/inittab</I><BR>
<UL>
<P>
dscc:2345:respawn:/usr/local/bin/distccd --verbose --no-detach
--daemon<BR>
</UL>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_6>
RUNNING FROM INETD</A>
</H2>
distccd may be started from a network super-server such as inetd
or xinetd.  In this case inetd listens for network connections
and invokes distccd when one arrives.<BR>
<P>
This is slightly less efficient than running a standalone distccd
daemon.  distccd is not able to regulate the number of concurrent
jobs accepted, but there may be an option in your inetd configuration
to do so.<BR>
<P>
For traditional Unix inetd, a line like this can be added to /etc/inetd.conf:<BR>
<UL>
<P>
distcc stream tcp nowait.6000 root /usr/local/bin/distccd distccd
--inetd<BR>
</UL>
<P>
inetd imposes a limit on the rate of connections to a service
to protect against accidental or intentional overuse.  The default
in Linux NetKit inetd is 40 per minute, which is far  too low
for distccd. The .6000 option raises the limit to 6000 per minute.<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_7>
TERMINATING DISTCCD</A>
</H2>
To shut down a standalone server, send a SIGTERM signal to the
parent process.  The most reliable way to do this from a script
is to use the <I> --pid-file</I> option to record its process
ID.  Shutting down the server in this way should allow any jobs
currently in progress to complete.<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_8>
OPTIONS</A>
</H2>
<BR>
<DL>
<DT>
<B>--help</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Display summary usage information.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--version</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Shows the daemon version and exits.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>-j, --jobs JOBS</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Sets a limit on the number of jobs that can be accepted at any
time. By default this is set to two greater than the number of
CPUs on the machine, to allow for some processes being blocked
on network IO. (Daemon mode only.)<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>-N, --nice NICENESS</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Makes the daemon more nice about giving up the CPU to other tasks
on the machine.  NICENESS is an increment to the current priority
of the process.  The range of priorities depends on the operating
system but is typically 0 to 20.  By default the niceness is increased
by 5.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>-p, --port PORT</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Set the TCP port to listen on, rather than the default of 3632.
(Daemon mode only.)<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--listen ADDRESS</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Instructs the distccd daemon to listen on the IP address ADDRESS.
This can be useful for access control on dual-homed hosts.  (Daemon
mode only.)<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>-P, --pid-file FILE</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Save daemon process id to file FILE.  (Daemon mode only.)<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--user USER</B>
</DT>
<DD>
If distccd gets executed as root, change to user USER.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>-a, --allow IPADDR[/MASK]</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Instructs distccd to accept connections from the IP address IPADDR.
A CIDR mask length can be supplied optionally after a trailing
slash, e.g. 192.168.0.0/24, in which case addresses that match
in the most significant MASK bits will be allowed.  If no --allow
options are specified, distccd will exit immediately!  Unauthorized
connections are rejected by closing the TCP connection immediately.
A warning is logged on the server but nothing is sent to the client.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--job-lifetime SECONDS</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Kills a distccd job if it runs for more than SECONDS seconds.
This prevents denial of service from clients that don't properly
disconnect and compilers that fail to terminate. By default this
is turned off.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--no-detach</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Do not detach from the shell that started the daemon.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--no-fork</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Don't fork children for each connection, to allow attaching gdb.
Don't use this if you don't understand it!<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--log-file FILE</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Send messages to file FILE instead of syslog. Logging directly
to a file is significantly faster than going via syslog and is
recommended.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--log-level LEVEL</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Set the minimum severity of error that will be included in the
log file.  Useful if you only want to see error messages rather
than an entry for each connection.  LEVEL can be any of the standard
syslog levels, and in particular <I> critical, error, warning,
notice, info,</I> or <I> debug.</I><BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--log-stderr</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Send log messages to stderr, rather than to a file or syslog.
This is mainly intended for use in debugging.  Do not use in inetd
mode.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--verbose</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Include debug messages in log.  Equivalent to <B> --log-level=debug</B><BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--wizard</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Turn on all options appropriate for starting distccd under gdb:
run as a daemon, log verbosely to stderr, and do not detach or
fork.  For wizards only.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--stats</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Turn on the statistics HTTP server. By default it is off. (Daemon
mode only.)<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--stats-port PORT</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Set the TCP port to listen on for HTTP requests, rather than the
default of 3633. (Daemon mode only.)<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--inetd</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Serve a client connected to stdin/stdout.  As the name suggests,
this option should be used when distccd is run from within a super-server
like inetd.  distccd assumes inetd mode when stdin is a socket.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--daemon</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Bind and listen on a socket, rather than running from inetd. 
This is used for standalone mode.  distccd assumes daemon mode
at startup if stdin is a tty, so --daemon should be explicitly
specified when starting distccd from a script or in a non-interactive
ssh connection.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--zeroconf</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Register the availability of this distccd server using Avahi Zeroconf
DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD).  This allows distcc clients on
the local network to access this distccd server without explicitly
listing its host name or IP address in their distcc host list:
the distcc clients can just use &quot;+zeroconf&quot; in their
distcc host lists. <B> This option is only available if distccd
was compiled with</B> <B> Avahi support enabled.</B><BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--auth</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Perform GSS-API based mutual authentication. <B> This option is
only available if distccd was compiled with</B> <B> the --with-auth
configure option.</B><BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--show-principal</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Displays the name of the distccd security principal extracted
from the environment. <B> This option is only available if distccd
was compiled with</B> <B> the --with-auth configure option.</B><BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--blacklist=FILE</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Instruct distccd to reject connections from users whose principal
names are listed in FILE. <B> This option is only available if
distccd was compiled with</B> <B> the --with-auth configure option
and if distccd is run with the</B> <B> --auth option.</B><BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>--whitelist=FILE</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Instruct distccd to accept connections only from users whose principal
names are listed in FILE. <B> This option is only available if
distccd was compiled with</B> <B> the --with-auth configure option
and if distccd is run with the</B> <B> --auth option.</B><BR>
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_9>
SEARCH PATHS</A>
</H2>
<BR>
<P>
distcc can pass either a relative or an absolute name for the
compiler to distccd.  If distcc is given an explicit absolute
compiler filename, that name is used verbatim on both the client
and server. If the compiler name is not an absolute path, or if
the client is used in masquerade mode, then the server's PATH
is searched.<BR>
<P>
distccd inherits its search path from its parent process.  By
default distccd tries to remove directories that seem to contain
distccd masquerade links, to guard against inadvertent recursion.
The <B> DISTCCD_PATH</B> environment variable may be used to set
the path.<BR>
<P>
The search path is logged when --verbose is given.  In case of
confusion, check the logs.<BR>
<P>
When distccd is run over ssh, the <I> $HOME/.ssh/environment</I>
file may be useful in setting the path.  See <B> ssh(1).</B><BR>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_10>
DIAGNOSTICS</A>
</H2>
distccd logs messages to syslog's <I> daemon</I> facility by default,
which normally writes to <I> /var/log/daemon</I> or <I> /var/log/messages.</I>
Log messages can be sent to a different file using the <B> --log-file
option.</B><BR>
<H2>
<A NAME=TOC_11>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</A>
</H2>
<BR>
<DL>
<DT>
<B>DISTCC_CMDLIST</B>
</DT>
<DD>
If the environment variable DISTCC_CMDLIST is set, load a list
of supported commands from the file named by DISTCC_CMDLIST, and
refuse to serve any command whose last DISTCC_CMDLIST_MATCHWORDS
last words do not match those of a command in that list.  See
the comments in src/serve.c.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>DISTCC_CMDLIST_NUMWORDS</B>
</DT>
<DD>
The number of words, from the end of the command, to match. The
default is 1.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>DISTCCD_PATH</B>
</DT>
<DD>
When starting distccd, if this value is set it will be used unaltered
for the command-execution PATH.  The code that normally tries
to remove masquerade directories from the path is skipped.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>DISTCC_SAVE_TEMPS</B>
</DT>
<DD>
If set to 1, temporary files are not deleted after use.<BR>
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Note that <B> DISTCC_LOG</B> does not affect the log destination
for the server.<BR>
<DL>
<DT>
<B>DISTCC_TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT</B>
</DT>
<DD>
On Linux, turn on the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT socket option.  Defaults
to on.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>TMPDIR</B>
</DT>
<DD>
Directory for temporary files such as preprocessor output.  By
default /tmp/ is used.<BR>
</DD>
<DT>
<B>DISTCCD_PRINCIPAL</B>
</DT>
<DD>
If set, specifies the name of the principal that distccd runs
under, and is used to authenticate with the client. <B> This environment
variable is only used if distccd was compiled with</B> <B> the
--with-auth configure option and if distccd is run with the --auth
option.</B><BR>

BUGS</A>
</H2>
IP-based access control is not secure against attackers able to
spoof TCP connections, and cannot discriminate different users
on a client.<BR>
<P>
TCP connections are not secure against attackers able to observe
or modify network traffic.<BR>
<P>
Because ccache does not cache compilation from <B> .i</B> files,
it is not useful to call it from distccd.<BR>
