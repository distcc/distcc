# Usage: find_c_extension.sh BUILDDIR
#
# Write path of directory containing C-extension of build directory.
#
# More precisely, locate the unique directory of the form:
#
#   _include_server/lib.*/include_server/
#
# that contains file 'distcc_pump_c_extensions.so'. Write the path of this
# directory to stdout and exit with status 0. If such a path does not exist
# then write error message to stderr and exit with status 1.

builddir="$1"
# We want to catch the file whether it's .so (unix) or .dll (cygwin).
# The '[sd][ol]*' glob does that without having to worry about
# unpredictable 'ls' behavior when a glob has no matches.
# (Side note: there is intense internal debate about whether the
# '[sd][ol]' hack is "so ugly I can't stand it" or "kinda cute".)
