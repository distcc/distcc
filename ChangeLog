	* test/testdistcc.py:

	  Fix some issues that caused the gdb-related tests to fail:

	  1. Recent gcc versions want us to use -Wl,--build-id
	  rather than --build-id.

	  2. We had missed one of the places where we need to be passing
	  that flag in.

	  3. With recent gcc/gdb versions, "break main; run"
	  will sometimes stop at the first statement inside of main
	  rather than on the function declaration.
	  So "break main; run; step" may end up inside the code to
	  puts() rather than in the code for main().
	  My fix was to use "break main; run; next" instead.
	  It is inderminate (varies based on whether you use "-O", for example)
	  whether we end up at the call to puts() or after the call to puts(),
	  but either way the call to puts() should be in the gdb output log.

2008-12-02 21:44  Fergus Henderson <opensource@google.com>

	* Makefile.in, NEWS, configure.ac, include_server/setup.py:

	  1. Fix some compilation errors arising from the use of
	  -Wwrite-strings when compiling the python extension module,
	  due to lack of const correctness in the Python 2.2
	  "Python.h" header file.
	  This problem was introduced by the fix for distcc issue 26
	  <http://code.google.com/p/distcc/issues/detail?id=26>.
	  The solution was to explicitly disable these warnings
	  with -Wno-write-strings.

	  2. Centralize the use of gcc-specific compilation options
	  in conditional code in configure.ac that is only executed
	  if we're using gcc. Previously include_server/setup.py
	  was hard-coding gcc-specific options, regardless of
	  whether we're using gcc.

	  3. Don't use -Wuninitialized if CFLAGS doesn't contain "-O*",
	  because -Wuninitialized only works if optimization is enabled.
	  This avoids a gcc warning (and hence an error with -Werror)
	  about -Wuninitialized not having any effect
	  when distcc is configured with "CFLAGS=-g ./configure".

	  4. Add a new configure option "--disable-Werror".

	  For the 3.0 release of distcc, some people porting distcc
	  resorted to patching distcc to remove the -Werror option.
	  -Werror is useful, so I want to keep it enabled by default,
	  but I'd prefer that people are able to port distcc easily,
	  hence the configure option.

	  This addresses distcc issue 20
	  <http://code.google.com/p/distcc/issues/detail?id=20>.

	  klarlund/d3b3

	  Fix Issue 7: Compiling with -I/usr/include/FOO or ... in pump mode

	  Problem:

	  Default system include directories are the directories on the default
	  include
	  search path, such as /usr/include, that is determined by the compiler.
	  Distcc
	  will not send default system include directories to the distcc
	  compilation
	  servers. Nevertheless, distcc on the server blindly rewrites -I
	  options such
	  as -I/usr/include/foo to -I/tmp/distccNNN/usr/include/foo.

	  This doesn't work, since the files in /usr/include/foo are not sent to
	  the
	  distccd server.

	  Solution:

	  The present solution keeps the rewriting on the server, because we
	  would like
	  to not manage starting the compiler, parsing its output, and storing
	  the
	  default system paths on the server

	  Instead, we use the existing mechanism for defining relative symbolic
	  links
	  under the server root. We escape from the root by using a sufficient
	  number
	  of '../'s.

	  All this is tremendously complicated by:

	  -- The possibility that other links encountered may point into the
	  system
	  default dirs in which case the usual mirroring of the reachable places
	  should not take place, because the routing of such links will go
	  through
	  the link created for the system directory.

	  -- The fact that determination of default-system-dirness is lazy: a
	  deeply-seated link in a default system dir may become obsolete if it
	  is
	  later determined that a higher directory than the parent directory of
	  the
	  link is in fact also a default system dir. In that case, a new
	  symlink,
	  sitting in a place higher than the previous one will need to be
	  created.

	  Tests:

	  make check
	  benchmarks: samba (still 3X faster than with distcc), linux 2.6
	  kernel, and
	  a couple of others

	* configure.ac, src/snprintf.c, src/trace.c, src/va_copy.h:

	  Fix a bug that caused "make check" to fail: MissingCompiler_Case
	  was reporting an unexpected exit status: 139 instead of 110.
	  This was caused by a seg fault in distccd, deep in the bowels of
	  vsnprintf(), which appears to be due to calling vsnprintf() twice
	  on the same va_list. The fix is to use va_copy() in src/trace.c.

	  Of course it's never quite as easy as that. va_copy() exists
	  only in C99, not in C89. Some implementations have __va_copy()
	  but not va_copy(). So we need to autoconf it. There was
	  already an autoconf test for this, but only for __va_copy.
	  I've moved the code which defined VA_COPY from snprintf.c to
	  a new header file va_copy.h, and added a VA_COPY_END macro.

	  Also, fix another bug that I noticed at the same time:
	  snprintf.c was using va_copy(), but was not matching each
	  call to va_copy with a corresponding call to va_end(),
	  as required by the C99 standard.

	* Makefile.in:

	  Note: this fix is slightly different than the original patch
	  that I posted to the distcc mailing list. This patch is better
	  because it fixes the install.log file, rather than just the

	* Makefile.in:

	  It turns out setup.py has a bug(?) in its --record output: in theory,
	  the paths of the --record fields should start with --prefix, but
	  sometimes the paths remove the leading / from --prefix:

	  % env CPPFLAGS='-Isrc -Ilzo -Ipopt' SRCDIR=`pwd`
	  include_server/setup.py install --prefix=/tmp/distcc-bar
	  --record=/dev/stdout --root=/var/

	  % env CPPFLAGS='-Isrc -Ilzo -Ipopt' SRCDIR=`pwd`

	  --record=/dev/stdout --root=/var
	  /tmp/distcc-bar/lib/python2.4/site-packages/include_server/parse_file_test.pyc
	  [...]

	  It's hard to predict how, when and why it does this (--root=/ and
	  --root="" are particularly confusing cases), but luckily we know we
	  always want the leading slash: configure dies if --prefix isn't an
	  absolute path. So with this change, we just let setup.py write
	  whatever it wants to, and then add a leading slash before each line of
	  the --record output if it's missing.

	  Tested by running
	  ./configure --prefix=/tmp/distcc
	  rm -rf /tmp/distcc; make install
	  rm -rf /var/tmp/tmp/distcc; make install DESTDIR=/var/tmp
	  rm -rf /var/tmp/tmp/distcc; make install DESTDIR=/var/tmp/
	  and verified that files ended up where expected, and the pump script
	  looked like expected (with pump's sibling files living in

	  Fix option real_path_warning_re not working.

	  I renamed the option to path_observation_re. Now by prefixing

	  INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS='-d1 --path_observation_re="/usr/.*"'

	  to say make include-server-maintainer-check, one gets a message each
	  time the
	  include server finds a path whose realpath name matches the regular
	  expression.
	  That results in messages like:

	  WARNING include server: For translation unit 'src/testtmp.c', lookup
	  of file
	  'bits/stdio_lim.h' resolved to '/usr/include/bits/stdio_lim.h' whose
	  realpath is
	  '/usr/include/bits/stdio_lim.h'.

	  To make the interpretation of quoted arguments within
	  INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS
	  correct, I added 'eval' to the command that cranks up the include
	  server. I
	  remembered to put extra quoted quotes inside the parameters that
	  should be

	* test/comfychair.py, test/testdistcc.py:

	  Testing on cygwine revealed that as tests were being issued the
	  temporary
	  testing directory would suffer from longer and longer prefixes until a
	  'filename
	  too long' error would stop the party. This is result of an earlier
	  attempt to
	  avoid too much printing to stdout during tests, spefically during
	  recursive test
	  invocations.

	  The problem is that the teardown mechanism of the comfychair
	  enviroment is not
	  expressed -- by any name at all (it could be 'teardown' for example).
	  So, I
	  added a name --- but because there's no expectation that the TestCase
	  class
	  defined there has its teardown method called from derived classes ---
	  I chose
	  the name CleanUps, which corresponds to the private variable.

	  I also made an abstraction for running a test. This new
	  Comfychair.runtest
	  function can the conveniently by called to carry out a subtest.

	  With this CL, 'make pump-maintainer-check' now works on cygwin.

	  Some changes to the benchmark framework to not redo work
	  unnecessarily. Most prominently, no longer re-run 'tar xf &&
	  configure' every benchmark run. Instead, if configure was
	  successfully executed last benchmark run, just do 'make clean'. This
	  is equivalent to what we do now between build runs, when the
	  repeat-count is > 1.

	  This feature is not turned on by default, but must be enabled with the
	  new --force=0 flag. --force=1 keeps the same behavior as before: we
	  always re-run configure in each build-directory. --force=2 adds more
	  repeat-work than before; in --force=2 mode, we always re-download the
	  package from the web, even if we had successfully downloaded it
	  before.

	  Note that the 'tar' command currently warms the file-cache, which

2008-05-29 01:46  Craig Silverstein <opensource@google.com>

	* src/dotd.c, src/dotd.h, src/emaillog.c, src/emaillog.h:

	  Fix some of the written-on dates for some google patches. Pointed out
	  by fergus.

	* pump.in:

	  Fix unproctected invocation of distcc and numeric designation of one
	  with a
	  plural noun.

	  I discovered this bug by deleting /usr/bin/distcc. I did that after I
	  found out
	  that the Linux kernel compilation is suffering from a similar issue
	  (amongst
	  others), because the PATH is apparently rewritten.

	* include_server/cache_basics.py, include_server/parse_command.py:

	  Remove spurious warning messages about absolute filepaths.

	  During compilation of the Linux kernel messages like:

	  absolute filepath blabla.h was IGNORED (correctness of build may be
	  affected)

	  are issued. They are wrong. The problem is that -include or -imacro or
	  even
	  source file names with absolute filepaths trigger a complaint from the
	  caching
	  mechanism usually used for relative file names.

	  We correct this problem.

	  We also substitute fp_map for includepath_map, which is the now
	  preferred term.

	  Make the Linux 2.6 kernel build with distcc-pump mode.

	  Add a new piece of command line parse information: send_systemdirs.
	  This

	  with a
	  default system directory (one known to the compiler).

	  With send_systemdirs true, the compiler headers of system headers are
	  sent to
	  the servers and mounted under the server root. The isystem option is
	  as usual
	  rewritten to be relative to the root. Without this flag setting,
	  distcc quickly
	  decides that pump mode is not viable because remote compilations fail.

	  Also, fixed the comment:

	  # default symbols.

	  TRIVIA: the about 1000 files in the kernel build involve on average
	  400
	  headers. The build time on a quad-cpu machine drops from about 1m40 s
	  to 1m20s.
	  With pump-mode, the machine is underutilized judging from the total
	  sys + user
	  time, which is around only 2m20s.

	  NOTE: this is a successor to 'g6n8', which simply introduced a command
	  line
	  option to force sending of system files. A bug in gvn did not allow me
	  to
	  resuse that change list.

2008-05-23 03:12  Nils Klarlund <opensource@google.com>

	* include_server/include_analyzer.py, include_server/mirror_path.py:

	  Fix unsoundess of directory replication.

	  Testing of distcc-pump mode on the Linux kernel showed that the
	  computed include
	  closure was sometimes wrong: header files were missing.

	  Further testing showed that sometimes apparently not even the
	  compilation unit
	  made it across to the server or rather, the c-file in its real
	  location would
	  come across, but the path designating it would not.

	  Take as an example: compilation unit is designated by the path
	  ../bar/baz.c and
	  the current directory is /foo but no files in /foo are in actuality
	  referenced
	  during include processing. Then the compilation server will get
	  /PREFIX/bar/baz.h -- the image of the real file -- but /PREFIX/foo,
	  the image of
	  the current directory, will not even be created!

	  So, this CL corrects an oversight in the way that the include
	  processor
	  explores files: although it does take into account the chasing of
	  symbolic links,
	  no provisions are in place to properly model '..' for climbing up
	  directories.
	  Specifically, to climb up a directory, it must exist! Usually, the
	  directory in
	  fact would exist on the server, because it would be replicated thanks
	  to the
	  header files it contains. But there is no guarentee.

	  We solve this problem by forcing the creation of dummy .c files the
	  first time a
	  path is explored. Because paths are being investigated backwards (from
	  the end),
	  forcing results in extra files only at the "deep" levels. Since files
	  are
	  usually clustered together in directories, the addition of a dummy
	  file per deep
	  directory should be inconsequential for performance.

	  TBD: integration level tests that this really work. I will either
	  include that
	  later or in a separate CL.

	  Tested:

	  make pump-maintainer-check

	  build the Linux 2.6 kernel in true pump-mode (with extra patch, to be
	  described separately that sends compiler system files to the server)
	  [all
	  files but a few towards the end suffer from absolute includes are
	  preprocessed and compiled on the compile servers!]

	  The command I used is:

	  DISTCC_EMAILLOG_WHOM_TO_BLAME=Nils Klarlund <opensource@google.com>
	  DISTCC_ENABLE_DISCREPANCY_EMAIL=1 INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS='-d1 -t --email
	  --stat_reset_triggers=include/linux/compile.h'

	  -P3 -k100 -d`" PATH=/home/klarlund/svn-distcc/distcc:$PATH
	  ./masquerade pump make -j120

	  I had to delete /usr/bin/distcc for this work, because of the PATH
	  acrobatics
	  that the kernel makefiles apparently exercise. Otherwise,
	  /usr/bin/distcc
	  would sometimes get called.

	  Add '--unsafe_absolute_includes' option so that more can be compiled

	  An occurrence of say

	  that the
	  file /usr/include/acl.h exists on the host. With this option, these
	  includes
	  will be ignored.

	  A message like:

	  WARNING include server: absolute filepath '/usr/include/acl.h' was

	  Fix a bug where "/etc/init.d/distcc stop" was not working when you had

	  /proc/<pid>/exe against /usr/bin/distccd by comparing inode numbers.
	  Comparing inode numbers doesn't work, because when we install a new
	  distccd, we create a fresh file with a new inode number, so the inode
	  number used by running processes won't match the inode number of
	  /usr/bin/distccd on disk after you've installed a new version.

	  The fix was to remove the "--exec /usr/bin/distccd"

	  I used a little script to find the include server timings as a

	  --gc_threshold=700' \
	  /usr/bin/time -p make-dbg -j120 -r -experimental-ld -g0 gws:gws"

	  with various values of gc_threshold.

	  The measurement were done on a four processor system (dual Opterons),
	  loaded
	  with an nxserver process. Files were served through Fuse.


	  gc include server user + sys time
	  setting

	  700 155.1s 154.0s 164.7s 186.1s 154.3s Mean: 162.8
	  10000 123.8s 125.4s 120.6s 120.4s 121.0s Mean: 122.2
	  100000 123.4s 123.3s 122.2s 123.3s 116.5s Mean: 121.7

	  700 166.5s 156.4s 150.8s 153.4s 155.4s Mean: 156.5
	  10000 120.7s 142.1s 118.3s 117.7s 119.2s Mean: 123.6
	  100000 140.3s 117.1s 149.7s 116.7s 141.6s Mean: 123.6


	  The corresponding elapsed times:

	  371.0s 363.3s 361.9s 370.8s 369.0s Mean: 367.2
	  341.8s 346.1s 336.3s 338.3s 340.5s Mean: 340.6
	  345.9s 338.5s 342.9s 374.4s 340.0s Mean: 348.3

	  377.4s 379.9s 387.1s 377.4s 373.2s Mean: 379.0
	  332.1s 337.7s 336.5s 332.2s 314.7s Mean: 330.6
	  341.1s 334.6s 357.8s 338.5s 352.4s Mean: 344.9

	  Note that the saving in include server time is around 35s, but the
	  savings in
	  elapsed time is around 44s. These numbers are uncertain. Even so, they
	  strongly
	  indicate that the include server is a signifcant bottleneck.

	  BTW, for comparison with plain distcc:

	  821.4s 822.0s 842.4s 821.5s 852.0s Mean: 831.9
	  878.7s 857.2s 860.3s 880.1s 856.0s Mean: 866.5

	  Thus, pump-mode 2.5X is faster than plain distcc (with the
	  set_threshold =
	  10000 of this CL).

	* src/exec.c:

	  There's cygwin-specific code in exec.c, but it seems to assume that
	  when running under cygwin, we'll be using a native windows app to
	  compile. But sometimes we're using a cygwin app (eg /bin/gcc).
	  Trying to use native-windows forking routines with cygwin apps causes
	  a segfault (and takes a while to do it); we need to use unix forking
	  routines there.

	  With this change, when we're asked to spawn a sub-process, we try to
	  guess whether the sup-process app is windows or cygwin, based on its
	  path location (this benefits from using absolute paths):
	  /bin/gcc
	  vs
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\bin\cl.exe
	  or even
	  C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003/Vc7/bin/cl.exe

	  If we decide it's a windows app but are wrong, then the
	  windows-forking code should eventually fail with "file not found"; in
	  that case, we fall through to the normal unix-fork case, to give
	  cygwin a chance to find the binary.

	  I also took the opportunity to clean up some of the code (handles
	  should be initialized to ILLEGAL_HANDLE values, not NULL). I also
	  replaced the crazy permissions the code was asking for before, with
	  normal GENERIC_READ/GENERIC_WRITE. This allows the code to work when
	  the tmpdir is c:\windows, which was failing before.

	  Tested on cygwin using /bin/gcc as the compiler, like so:
	  ./distcc /bin/gcc -c testtmp.c -o testtmp.o
	  where testtmp.c is a simple "hello world" program.

	  I also tested by running 'make check'. With this change, 'make check'
	  passes on cygwin! (Using gcc to do compilations.)

	  1) find_c_extension looks for .dll files in addition to .so files.

	  cp on them), it does.

	  3) testdistcc.py adds a routine to detect PE binaries. These, like
	  dwarf binaries, do not always give reproducible output on the same
	  input, so take that into account in the gdb tests.

	  4) In the lsdistcc test, we assumed that when the ping failed,
	  127.0.0.2 isn't available. But it's also possible ping is just broken
	  (or different) on that machine. So in the failed-ping case, we no

	  Fix what appears to be a bug in the handling of DISTCC_CMDLIST.

	  The documentation is not very clear, but distccd was documented
	  as matching against the last DISTCC_CMDLIST_NUMWORDS words of the
	  command, where I think by words they meant directory components.
	  For example, if the file refered to by DISTCC_CMDLIST contains the
	  line
	  "/usr/bin/i686-blah-blah/gcc", and DISTCC_CMDLIST_NUMWORDS=2, only
	  commands which end in "/i686-blah-blah/gcc" would be matched.
	  The bug is that a command "i686-blah-blah/gcc" should be considered
	  to match.

	  Likewise, if DISTCC_CMDLIST contains the line "/usr/bin/gcc", and
	  DISTCC_CMDLIST_NUMWORDS is 1 (or not set), then plain "gcc" should be
	  allowed to match.

	  Make handling of config.h sound.

	  (1) Correct order of -Is in Makefile.

	  (2) remove unnessary PATH modification in configure.ac (this is
	  fergus's
	  suggestion -- hopefully this will do, this replaces a circumvention
	  mechanism I
	  had originally concocted.

	  (3) Fix place of the include of popt in CPPFLAGS.

	  (4) Convert quoted includes of config.h to angle bracket includes so
	  that the
	  build version, not the source version, of this file is picked up.

	  The order of -Is in the build system is wrong: it contradicts the
	  VPATH mechanism.

	  This means that builds in a build directory different from that
	  of the source (distribution) directory will find wrong files even
	  after the hapless developer has issued only a 'configure' command
	  in the source directory (but not actually 'made' any thing
	  there). For in that case, the src/config.h will be generated in
	  the source directory and this will be the file picked in the
	  build directory even if that directory has it's own src/config.h.
	  This can lead to wrong builds and it can be hard to diagnose the
	  problem.

	  Currently, this what CPPFLAGS end up being (as found in the
	  generated Makefile):

	  CPPFLAGS = -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -D_GNU_SOURCE \
	  -I../distcc/popt -I../distcc/src \
	  ${DIR_DEFS} \
	  -Isrc -Ilzo \
	  -I"$(srcdir)/src" -I"$(srcdir)/lzo" \

	  Here my source dir was ../distcc.

	  The presence of '-I../distcc/popt' in front of -Isrc is the exact
	  opposite of the semantics of VPATH mechanism, which looks for
	  files in the build directory, then in the source directory.

	  Also, note the remarks in:

	  http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Configuration-Headers

	  (they do not quite correctly discuss the search path, btw).

	  TESTING: I verified that with a corrupted config.h file in the source
	  directory,
	  building now succeeds.

	  Also: make distcheck (it fails the same place as before: this is
	  corrected in
	  another change of mine --- I'll verify that with that change in place,
	  this
	  change makes 'make distcheck' succeed.)

	* Makefile.in, find_c_extension.sh, include_server/setup.py, pump.in:

	  Rewrite setup.py and associated logic to fix multiple build problems.

	  The recent distcheck revealed that paths were set incorrectly for the
	  setup.py
	  script. Also, as I dug deeper, it turned out that built files were
	  placed in
	  the src directory (thanks to os.path.join I found in the distutil's
	  source code,
	  that trips up the location if relative paths contains too many
	  '..'s.). [The
	  distccheck revealed this!] I didn't like either that setup was run in
	  the
	  source directory and not from the build directory (that's asking for
	  trouble).
	  I did't like either that the search path, the list of includes, in
	  setup.py was
	  handcoded and not simply that of CPPFLAGS. Finally, I was confused by
	  _builddir
	  being another build directory under $(buildir). I renamed the former
	  _include_server to better explain its role.

	  So, I rewrote most of setup.py (correcting some of the documentation
	  strings
	  along the way). Also, I partly removed the 'jumping through the hoops'
	  gymnastics from the Makefile.

	  in though. I replaced them with 2.2-compatible code.

	  2) The test system used the --ex flag to gdb, which is only supported

	  which is supported in old gdb's as well. I also added a workaround
	  for a buggy error-message that gdb sometimes emits. See

	* Makefile.in, find_c_extension.sh, include_server/c_extensions_test.py,
	  pump.in:

	  Make install-checks work and a lot of clean-up in regards to the
	  'checking'
	  targets.

	  - Remove temporary installation for include server tests. The current
	  scheme
	  doesn't make too much sense: when testing a real installation, the
	  include
	  server is tested in the separate temporary installation.

	  Instead, we propose to make the installation tests run only the
	  regression
	  tests in the 'test' directory, unpumped and pumped. The include server
	  is now
	  tested as part of maintainer-check only, but run out of the source
	  directory,
	  except for the C extension module.

	  - The maintainer-check and the maintainer-install-check now run the
	  integration
	  test (test/testdistcc.py) also in pump mode.

	  - A new script, find_c_extension.sh, is added; it finds the location
	  of the
	  shared library. It is used for both running the include server tests
	  and the
	  regression tests out of the built (not installed) version of the
	  software. It
	  was cut of the 'pump' script, which now has been simplified.

	  - Reorganize the order of affected targets. Introduce
	  '###############...' as
	  separator between sections of Makefile in a more consistent way. Make
	  each
	  section consistently declare all the phony targets at the beginning of
	  the
	  section.

	  - Introduce DISTCC_INSTALLATION variable to account for the precise
	  location
	  of the tested binaries in an installation.

	  - Add verify-binaries-installcheck target to ensure that binaries are
	  in this
	  location.

	  - Also, this target reports the location to users:

	  Make sure all paths below are where you expect them to be:
	  **********************************************************
	  /home/klarlund/svn-distcc/mybin/installation/bin/distcc
	  /home/klarlund/svn-distcc/mybin/installation/bin/distccd
	  /home/klarlund/svn-distcc/mybin/installation/bin/distccmon-text
	  /home/klarlund/svn-distcc/mybin/installation/bin/lsdistcc
	  **********************************************************


	  - Absolutize a couple of relative directory references before they are
	  passed to
	  scripts, because otherwise things won't work with the disciplined
	  approach to
	  DISTCC_INSTALLATION.

	  - Change a randomly generated filename so that it resides in /tmp (in
	  c_extensions_test.py) and not inside the build directory tree. Fix up
	  logic
	  for filenaming to be more secure. This makes 'make distcheck' pass w/o
	  permission problems. Also, delete the temporary file and directory
	  when
	  test passes.

	  - Make include-server-maintainer-check remove the .out file when test
	  passes.
	  This makes 'make distcheck' pass the final test of the clean-out.

	  - Remove the 'Filtering' of the c_extensions_test output. This
	  filtering was
	  necessary in a previous version that printed all output to stdout to
	  reduce
	  user confusion. But now the test results go to intermediate files.
	  This
	  change was forced by the removal of the .out files (above).

	  'CFLAGS += $(POPT_FLAGS).' These may be fixable later.

	  1) #include differences
	  2) New errors due to some #ifdef paths being taken differently
	  3) Undefined functions (see, eg, the new HAVE_STRSEP)
	  4) Type differences (eg tv_usec is an int on os x, not a long int)

	  As one concrete example, snprintf.c is an empty file on linux, where
	  all the functionality is part of glibc. But on Solaris, some of its
	  functionality is useful. This turned up a bug where if you have
	  vsnprintf on your system but not vasnprintf, then dopr() was not being
	  used but was being defined, leading to an "unused static function"
	  warning in gcc.

	  As another, solaris would complain about "index" being used as a
	  variable, since it's also a function name. The var was renamed idx.

	  Tested by compiling on FreeBSD, Solaris 10, and OS X leopard (x86). I
	  also compiled and ran unittests under Linux Ubuntu, to make sure

	* INSTALL, Makefile.in, configure.ac, include_server/setup.py:

	  Resolve some TODO's in the Makefile (and, to a lesser extent, in
	  configure.ac):

	  1) Create a .gz tarfile as well as a .bz2 tarfile, with "make dist".
	  I've also added a few more dist rules: "make rpm", "make deb", and
	  "make alldist", though currently they're commented out since the
	  scripts they call have yet to be written.

	  2) setup.py looks at os.environ("BUILDDIR"), so make sure that
	  environment variable is always set properly.

	  3) setup.py was hard-coding the version number. Instead, have it get
	  it from the environment ("DISTCC_VERSION"), and set that envvar
	  before calling setup.py in the Makefile. (The alternate solution,
	  of making a setup.py.in and having configure set the version number
	  in setup.py, did not work well because the Makefile really wants
	  setup.py to be in $srcdir, that the configure option puts it in
	  builddir.)

	  4) Clean up distcheck to have three separate directories: src, build,
	  and install. Before src and build were the same. This pulled up
	  several places that were using srcdir instead of builddir, which I
	  fixed.

	  5) Clean up distcheck to make sure that 'make distclean' cleans all
	  the build files created during the build. At first it didn't
	  quite, so I fixed that up as well.

	  6) Added some new files to 'make dist': particularly, the files used
	  to build rpm and deb files.

	  7) Have maintainer-check and maintainer-installcheck both call the
	  same routine (via recursive make) rather than copy all that code.
	  This simplifies things surprisingly, especially since the main
	  check logic no longer has be inside a big "if $(PYTHON)".

	  8) (Various rules:) replace $^, which is not very portable, with a
	  repetition of the dependency line.

	  9) Rename GZIP to GZIP_BIN, since GZIP as an envvar is read by gzip
	  and parsed as gzip options.

	  10) In include_server/setup.py, we weren't setting builddir/src as an
	  include dir, and it needs to be (as 'make distcheck' shows). I'm
	  not sure builddir/../../src really needs to be anymore, but I guess
	  it can't hurt, so I've left it in.

	  11) Updated INSTALL to refer to autogen.sh, which will create
	  configure if it's not already there.

	  The only other change I made was to get rid of the hack I had put in

	  Merge configure.ac, distcc/configure.ac, and
	  include_server/configure.ac into a single, top-level configure.ac
	  script. Likewise with the three Makefile.in scripts. Now one config
	  file at the top level controls everything.

	  I had to rewrite quite a bit of code to account for the new level-up.
	  In particular, I had to add "distcc/" in front of many things in order
	  to refer to the same files I used to refer to when the
	  configure.ac/Makefile.in text lived in the distcc/ directory rather
	  than the top-level directory. Likewise (though to a lesser extent)
	  for include_server.

	  I also had to do a bit of merge work. Typically I'd leave the
	  originally-distcc-directory content as close to the original as
	  possible, and then try to put in the include_server directory stuff.

	  Most of the top-level configure.ac and Makefile.in could go away,
	  since they were glue before. I also could get rid of other top-level
	  helper scripts that were used for the glue, such as version.sh.

	  I also fixed a number of typos and other bugs:

	  Makefile.in:
	  1) Removed obsolete CVS comment (we're 3 source-control systems past
	  that now!)

	  2) distcc/Makefile.in was using top_builddir without importing it from
	  the configure script.

	  3) Add zeroconf.h to HEADERS, which is needed for 'make dist'. I also
	  added all the include_server files to 'make dist'.

	  4) "make dist" was passing 'h' ("no symlinks") to tar. This does not
	  work with the include_server test-suite, which includes symlinks.
	  I verified no other part of the distribution uses symlinks.
	  Removed the h.

	  5) "make dist" was missing a lot of stuff (including almost all the
	  include-server files). Updated it to get it all now. Likewise,
	  updated "make clean" and its cousins to be more precise. Also made
	  "make distcheck" more careful in checking that kind of thing.

	  6) Declared more phony targets .PHONY.

	  7) The include-server build commands do a lot of 'cd'-ing (since
	  setup.py requires it), and then using make variables that might
	  store relative directory paths. I now go through some hoops to
	  make those directory paths absolute before the cd.

	  8) "make pump-check" was not setting the path, so it was using the
	  installed distcc instead of the local one in the client. Fixed
	  that, and added a new target, "make pump-installcheck", to use the
	  installed distcc instead (parallel to the maintainer-check and
	  maintainer-installcheck targets).

	  configure.ac:
	  1) popt test was using $srcdir rather than required ${srcdir}, and
	  thus was always getting the empty string. (Luckily, srcdir is
	  usually ".", and the empty string is usually equivalent.)
	  Likewise when setting CPPFLAGS, which again didn't matter because
	  it turns out the relevant code was redundant with what autoconf
	  already does automatically.

	  2) A merge error: apparently the avahi check was added twice. Get rid
	  of the second one.

	  3) Was using obsolete AC_OUTPUT format. Use AC_CONFIG_FILES instead.

	  4) Added pkg.m4 to the m4/ directory. Before it only lived in
	  autoconf.m4. But my system, at least, doesn't have it.

	  5) include-server requires python2.4, so remove checks for earlier
	  pythons.

	  autogen.sh:
	  1) Added aclocal call. I think it was a bug that it was left out
	  before.

	  pump.in:
	  1) Fixed it to notice when it can't find the .so file it needs.

	  I also modified INSTALL to point to the new file locations, and the
	  new instructions to run them (eg no more run_all_autoconf.sh).

	  Despite all these bugfixes, I made the minimal changes possible to get
	  things to work. I marked with "TODO" further improvements I'd like to
	  make later.

	  One particular TODO is that I had to rename the "distcc" target -- the
	  main executable -- because it conflicts with the existing distcc
	  directory. This is a temporary breakage which will be fixed in the
	  next submit after this one, where I move the subdirs under distcc to
	  the top level, getting rid of the artificial extra directory
	  introduced.

	  Tested by running 'make maintainer-check', 'make distcheck', and 'make
	  pump-check' on my local machine, which passed. I've not tested all
	  the various configurations and options (including using avahi, using
	  the library popt library, building without python, etc). I've also
	  not tried 'make benchmark'.

	  Here's how I merged and updated content:

	  . README became README.pump. It was slightly edited for clarity. (I
	  also redid all the line-wrapping, which makes diff-ing
	  difficult. :-( ) distcc/README became README, with a small amount
	  of text added to describe 'pump' mode, and point to README.pump.

	  . distcc/NEWS became NEWS. pump functionality was added (a new
	  "distcc-3.0" entry). I also added all new features and bug-fixes
	  since we moved from arch to bzr. It looks like NEWS was
	  well-maintained before the move to bzr, so this might be pretty
	  complete. There may be some more pump-developed bugfixes we need to
	  add, though.

	  . I got rid of distcc/COPYING. Now COPYING is the only license in
	  this directory. This file was not changed. It remains the GPL 2.0
	  license.

	  . distcc/AUTHORS became AUTHORS. I changed Martin to maintainer
	  emeritus. I added the Google authors as authors of the "pump"
	  functionality, and current maintainers. I set the Google email
	  address to be distcc@googlegroups.com, which is a new group I've set
	  up to be the clearinghouse for distcc discussions.

	  . distcc/README.packaging became README.packaging. It was not
	  otherwise changed.

	  . distcc/TODO became TODO. It was not otherwise changed, except I
	  added that folks should look for FIXMEs in source files, not just
	  TODOs.

	  . I merged INSTALL and distcc/INSTALL (in that order). I rearranged
	  the text a little bit to remove redundancy (both talked about
	  running 'configure'), but did not make any contentful changes.

	  . I merged distcc/ChangeLog and distcc/ChangeLog.old to have a single
	  changelog again going all the way to 2002. Comments now separate
	  the various version control systems used. (svn is #4!) The single

	  (This patch comes from http://0pointer.de/public/distcc-avahi.patch,

	  repository was missing the new files from the avahi patch.)

	  I've also manually updated ChangeLog, which is not automatically
	  updated by bzr the same way it is by arch.

	  I've also added a new m4 directory, including non-standard autoconf
	  macros that we use. For now, it only includes ACX_PTHREAD (added by
	  the avahi patch) which I got from 0pointer.de. See the notes at the
	  top of m4/acx_pthread.m4 for more details.

	  I removed the change to Makefile.in that added in distccmon-gnome.1.
	  This file is not actually added in as part of this patch (it seems to
	  be part of a separate patch, at
	  http://patches.ubuntu.com/d/distcc/extracted/02_distccmongnome_man.dpatch),
	  and may have gotten in here by accident.

	  Tested by running 'make maintainer-check'. However, I did not test
	  with avahi installed, so I don't know how well that works.

	  r3, not part of this CL, is the "avahi" patch
	  (http://0pointer.de/public/distcc-avahi.patch). It was imperfectly
	  applied: the new files that are part of this patch were not added to
	  the bzr repository. We're following up with the patch-applier to see
	  if these files can be taken verbatim from the patch in the 0pointer
	  website. We'll also have to audit this patch to make sure it works
	  with distcc-pump without needing any changes. For those reasons,
	  we'll apply that patch in a separate change.

	Fix bug caused by non-idempotency of 'ln' and ensuing falsely positive
	test result.

	So, it turns out that 'ln -sf' is not idempotent. If C/D and E are
	directories, then

	     ln -sf $(readlink -f C/D) E/D

	creates a link E/D -> realpath(C/D) and subsequent

	     ln -sf $(readlink -f C/D) E/D

	creates a link C/D/D -> realpath(C/D), a self-reference of sorts. This
	is nasty because the second link created is in C/D, which was supposed
	to be just a target directory, not something to be modified!

	This bug enabled a faulty test to pass: the directory structure created
	by the non-potency bug is not cleaned on make clean. And the existence of
	the inserted extra directory made resolution of a certain include path
	possible when it should not have.

	Fix bug that leads to concurrent build interference: one distcc-pump
	build will severely affect another. The logic for naming the root
	directory was flawed: it used the pid of the parent, not the child,
	which is where the include server resides.

	Also fix less severe bug that allowed the cleaning up to end
	prematurely.

	The code is refactored at the same time -- for better readability and to
	address the parent/child pid confusion.

	The fix also includes the introduction of an additional communication
	mechanism, a semaphor: the child is now starting the include server and
	it must tell the parent that it has done so before the parent is allowed
	to exit.

	Testing:

	- 'make check'
	- Made several concurrent runs and verified that interference no longer
	  takes place.

	Fix an infinite loop in the include server. FindNode would call itself
	ad infinitum prompted by unusual link structures and includes.

	This change is non-trivial. In particular, it relates to a
	previous bug fix which is rolled-back as part of the present
	change -- and then the problem reported in the bug report is
	solved instead by properly mending the code that was removed in
	that change.  The fix consists of making the memoization removed
	in that change cognizant of the file directory or rather the
	absolute path of the file directory, see extensive new comments
	in class IncludeAnalyzerMemoizingNode.

	Small stuff: we change 'filepath' to 'fp' in all identifiers in
	FindNode. That's because the identifiers were otherwise getting too long
	in the new code. And, we used that abbreviation already.

	Testing: a test_DotdotInInclude test case specifically exercices the
	situation in the bug.  [Plus additional Google-specific correctness
	and performance tests.]

	Additionally, we're now doing the test_IncludeAnalyzer in two ways:
	directly and through a symlink farm. This helps us test regression
	against subtle bugs that may occur with symbolic links.

	Bump up length of interval that determines when SIGALRM is
	raised. Testing showed that with srcfs -- which increases user time --
	I/O between distcc and include server (in the C extension part) would be
	tripped up by SIGALRM when it is raised every 2s. This results in a
	Python exception such as IOError, which is wrong and even harmful,
	because it terminates the include server.  The interval in the currently
	released version is 3s, so 4s is better.

	This is to be followed up by CL that makes the algorithmic code
	"protected" by SIGALRM free of I/O.

	Increase time quota introduced in a previous change for handling a request.  We
	released pump17 10/22. One day later, it turns out that there are a
	cases where the include server spends more than 2s processsing a
	compilation unit. Here we increase the 2s to 3s.

	Limit the time that the includer analyzer is allowed to spend servicing
	a request. We use the rudimentary SIGALRM mechanism, because generally
	Python does not allow one thread to raise an exception in another.

	Experiments show that SIGALRM interferes with the use of Popen. When
	determining the default compiler, the include server uses Popen to
	invoke gcc. If the SIGALRM is raised, then it be caught in the 'select',
	which then aborts.

	Therefore, we stop the timer while the include server determines default
	compilers.

	The timeout exception is raised according to utime passed, not real
	time. That prevents the include server from going bananas, restarting
	again and again, because of NFS delays.

	The risk with this CL is that something else breaks in unexpected ways,
	perhaps a file operation, with the signaling. However, we've put the
	first signal to occur 2s after the start of the request. That should be
	more than ample time. In practice, we have not seen the include server
	using more than 2s per request (but this is based on limited
	measurements).

	We have also tested this change with a 1s timer. That showed the SIGALRM
	problem with Popen. After, we fixed that this CL seems to work fine.

	Partial rollback of a previous change.

	In particular, comment out the code to support the Objective-C file
	extensions and the Objective-C test case.  Currently Objective-C
	support breaks things if you don't have an Objective-C compiler
	installed, even if distcc is used only to compile C/C++ code; we try
	to compute the default include paths for all languages at startup,
	and barf it if fails.

	Leave in place the support for "#import".
	It turns out that "#import" can be used in GNU C/C++ code,

	*** Original change description ***

	Add support for Objective-C to distcc-pump.

	In particular, recognize the Objective-C file extensions (".m", ".mi")
	and the "#import" declaration.  (#import is like #include, but never
	includes the same file twice.  So for the distcc-pump include server,
	processing of #import is exactly the same as processing of #include.)

	Tested with "make maintainer-check" (all tests pass) and
	"make pump-check" (no regressions).  Also added a test of
	Objective-C compilation.

	Loosen assumption about the syntax -D options. A user had written
	something the include server couldn't understand. It provoked a rare
	internal error. The compilation did not succeed locally either. The
	include server must remain unfazed when confronted with weird syntax.

	Also, corrected comment for ParseCommandArgs.

	When storing warning messages in temporary file, we are using 'print
	>>', which appends a newline. Then, when presenting the errors to the
	user, we'd also use 'print', which appends another newline. With this
	fix, the newline is not append the first time around (we append
	','). The other use of the contents of the temporary file, in the mail
	sending routines, should not be affected by one less newline.

	Rather than just replacing the server's current working directory
	with the clients' current working directory, we need to replace
	the server's root directory with the client's root directory.

	This is needed because the problems with gdb arise not only
	from the "current working directory" field (DW_AT_comp_dir),
	but also with the file names (DW_AT_file_name).  These file names
	can be absolute paths to files that are outside of the current
	working directory.

	This change is basically just a one-line fix in serve.c, but
	for clarity I've also changed some variable names and comments
	in fix_debug_info.c.

	Prevent distcc-pump from reverting to local compilations hundreds
	or thousands of times. Such a situation should never occur but if it
	occurs, we want to fall back to distcc behavior. For example, this is
	desirable if the include server for reason picks up files that don't
	exist any more or symbolic links that changed surreptiously during the
	build.

	A typical output is shown below (where we have tampered with the include
	server to produce too few files).  Note that ERRORs still occur in the
	output (from the remote server).

	Introduce a time analysis of source files in order to improve S/N
	ratio of automatically generated error emails. Currently, we send
	an email in situations where:

	 -- the remote compilation fails because a file contains something bad,
	 -- the file is changed to not contain bad stuff, and consequently the
	 -- the local compilation succeeds.

	This makes it sometimes impossible for us to determine accurately from
	the email whether some error really occurred or whether the user changed
	source files during the build.

	We can carry out the analysis only if there is a .d file. We check each
	dependency descriped there. If anyone changed after the build started,
	then we really don't want to hear about distcc-pump errors, because
	dependencies shouldn't change. The generated files are exceptions. To
	disregard these, the distcc user may specify a glob pattern in
	environment variable DISTCC_EXCLUDE_FRESH_FILES defined when
	invoking distcc.

	Start a new snaphost of the file system when caches are cleared as part
	of the stat trigger mechanism.

	The stat reset is supposed to mean: ``don't trust anything about
	previous analyses of includes.'' So files, directories, and symbolic
	links, as known to the include server, are all invalid.

	In particular, all information gathered in the client root directory is
	stale. (This is where we compress source file and mirror the directory
	and link structure of the part of the file system explored for include
	analysis.)

	With this CL, we make the client root concept generational, as indicated
	by a new suffix, a generation number, added to the automatically
	generated root name.  A trigger event bumps the generation number by
	one.

	2) When an exception is raised it should generally be reported as a new
	warning (as defined by Debug called with DEBUG_WARNING, so that this
	output is controllable), not just printed to stderr.  In particular,
	this change makes situations not covered by the include processor (such
	as absolute filepaths in #include's) be reported as warnings.

	3) We removed an unnecessary try/except block for totally unexpected
	siutations. Those are to be handled by the general except clause of the
	'handler'.

	reported to stderr through print statements.

	If Ctrl-c is issued while the include server is running in 'handle',
	then an unfortunate double error message would sometimes occur, along
	with a stack trace. Fixed here by propagating exception to outer handler
	in 'Main'. [While we're at it, we change 'main' to 'Main'. There's no
	reason to lowercase it.]

	Also, we fix the situations where the exception raised in 'handle' is an
	internal error or the one corresponding to SIGTERM. Both situations are
	uncommon. And, in both cases, we raise SIGTERM for Main to catch, so
	that include server can be terminated without stack traces to be printed
	out.

	Fix bugs in dcc_get_dotd_info that give rise to erroneous .d file names
	or erroneous target names in .d files.

	- If derived from the file name given by -o, then the suffix must be
	  stripped before .d is appended.

	- If the file name ends in '.', then only "d" is appended.

	- If an -o name is given and the name ends in '.', then this name, not
	  the input filename, is still to be used for the name of the .d file.

	- If a target is provided in DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT, then this target must
	  be returned -- otherwise the .d file computed on the server will be
	  incorrect if the target happens not to be the object file.

	Extra: a test for the length of the string in variable extension was
	unnecessary.

	Tests: We made a unit test that exercices the function in a number of
	ways.  Heuristics about the names of .d files, expressed as globs, are
	used to pinpoint the actual naming conventions used by gcc.

	Reset caches more aggressively. According to a bug report,
	there are uncommon build situations where distcc-pump fails. We address
	this by:

	-- Making sure to reset the cache use by the link-gathering mechanism of
	   mirror_path in the include server. This is a real bug although
	   probably not the culprit.

	-- Also monitoring 'includes/third_party/stl/third_party/stl', which is
	   the symbolic link changed (with path-doubling) by the set symlink
	   mechanism of the third_party/stl/BUILD file.

	Propagate symbols defined through -D options to include analyzer. This
	makes computed includes operable wtih values provided on the command
	line.

	Tests:

	1. New tests exercise that when reissuing an analysis for the same file
	and with same search directories, but with a symbol definition affecting
	a previously computed include, the include graph is recalculated, not
	reused, and the new value of the symbol is used for resolving the
	computed include.

	2. The new code was also verified to solve the problem reported in
	a bug report (I used a workstation in ZRH to build the
	actual code that cause the issue).

	3. I did 'make maintainer-check'.

	Introduces mechanism for monitoring the real paths that are resolved
	during include analysis. Invoke as --realpath_warning_re=RE. For more,
	see include_server.py, Usage() in this CL. This allows a user to find
	out which source files are actually picked out by the include analysis
	during the build. Such information can useful if it is suspected that
	include directories are wrong.

	TESTING: this CL passes make check and make maintainer-check. It was
	tested earlier on Google software as part of the
	discussion of this feature now found on the distcc-pump wiki.

	From the wiki:

	    INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS='--realpath_warning_re=RE' make-dbg ....

	  makes the include server write a warning to stderr whenever a filename
	  is resolved to a realpath (a canonicalized absolute pathname - see
	  'man realpath') that is matched by RE, which is a regular expression
	  in Python syntax. For example, to find out which C/C++ files from
	  /home/build/buildonly are used during a build of gws:gws, do:

	    INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS='--realpath_warning_re=/auto/buildonly' make-dbg -distcc_pump -g0 gws:gws

	  Then, you will see messages like:

	  WARNING include server: For translation unit
	    'foo/bar.cc'
	  while processing 'foo/bar.cc'
	  lookup of file 'baz.h' resolved to
	    '../whatever/baz.h'
	  whose realpath is
	    '/auto/whatever/blah/blah/baz.h'.

	  (Here we have formatted the message from it's one-liner original.)
	  Note that the include server currently does not identify the header
	  file containing the #include for which the realpath matched, but only
	  the translation unit. Also, because of caching in the include server,
	  a message for a particular resolution appears usually only once. Thus
	  this analysis cannot be used to find out which files a particular
	  compilation unit uses.

	Introduce flag for NotCoveredError exceptions that specify whether
	email is to be sent or not.

	We use this parameter to suppress warnings that related to

	  #include "/foo/bar.h"

	and similar uses.

	Also, clean up of some error messages (add '.'). We fix a few typos and
	unneeded variables (e.g.: opt_build_stat_verify), while we're looking at
	these files.

	Additionally, improve NotCovered messages by adding the file name (in
	most cases).

	Finally, introduce option --no-email to negate the default of --email in
	the pump script if so desired through INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS.

	TESTING:

	This change passes 'make check' and 'make maintainer-check'. We also ran
	system tests and verified that occurences of #include "/foo/bar.h" now
	does not result in mail being generated. These tests are not part of
	this changelist, but contained in another change.

	Correct flawed configuration scripts and introduce configuration sanity
	checks.

	autoconfig assumes that if an .ac script has not changed then the
	resulting configure scripts do not need to change.

	This assumption is untrue because we use a shell escape. (This
	escape has been rewritten according to Fergus's suggestion.)

	Moreover, m4 caches processed files. This royally messes up things
	beyond and in addition to just the aforementioned problem.

	We fix this by using autoreconf (suggested by Fergus). It seems to
	address these issues.

	We have verified that:

	  ./run_all_autoconf.sh; ./configure; make clean; make all

	works and embeds a changed version number (in version.sh) in the right
	places.

	With further CLs "Remove Google crosstool specification" and
	"Introduce needed cast.", it is possible to use
	./build-distcc.sh to make RPM and .deb packages.

	according to Posix (specifically The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6,

	the arguments to select() are declared with the "restrict" attribute,

	Fix manual memory management bugs, and simplify the memory management

	dcc_set_output() was inconsistent about whether it copied its
	input argument or aliased it, about whether it freed the previous
	value in that slot.  I changed the function so that it always
	copies the input argument, and always frees the previous value
	in the argv array slot that it is about to overwrite.
	I likewise changed dcc_set_input to copy its argument.

	dcc_set_output() was also inconsistent about whether or not it
	logged the change to the argument; I fixed that too, by always
	logging it.

	In serve.c I simplified the code and comments a little - there
	is no longer any aliasing going on, so the deallocation logic
	is simpler.

	Make the handling of computed includes sound. Upto now, the include
	server failed to reprocess a file F with the property:
	- F transitively includes a file G
	- G contains a computed include and the support of its expression
	  contains a symbol X
	- X is defined or redefined after G is processed the first time

	We hope to compile OpenOffice with this fix.

	Little things:

	- Fixed include_analyzer_memoizing_node_test.py to allow regression test
	  for distcc itself to pass.

	- Removed dead code EvalExprDirs in include_analyzer.py.


	Correctness testing:

	 - In include_server: 'make test' works.

	 - Function test_AdvancedComputedIncludes is added in
	   'include_server/include_server_test.py'. It contains the basic
	   scenario we are correcting for.

	 - We ran multiple tests 'make-dbg -r -j80 third_party/lzo'; every test
	   succeeded. These did not succeed with existing version.

	 - We built gws:gws and localsearch/mustang

	Performance testing:

	  For make-dbg gws:gws -g0, the best time before the change:

	    make-dbg

		    real    7m44.230s
		    user    7m0.494s
		    sys     2m25.385s

	    Include server
	            Elapsed: 463.9s User: 72.5s System: 37.3s Total: 109.9s


	The best time after:

	    make-dbg
		    real    7m44.772s
		    user    6m46.249s
		    sys     2m2.944s
	    Include server
	            Elapsed: 464.6s User: 87.4s System: 36.9s User + System: 124.3s

	Thus, it seems that we've added 15s or about 8% to the include server
	time. (These times are on a hyperthreaded machine and therefore hard to
	interpret.)

	Remarks: the central algorithm still is in the need of refactoring. That
	8% running time was added because of the current change adds to my
	impression that the refactoring must be done with care.

	Don't try to send the preprocessed file to the server if the local

	Otherwise, either the file sent to the server is wrong, or it does not
	exist at all. In the first case, the result of the compilation is
	wrong. In the second, trying to send an existing file is considered a
	communication or remote error, and we end up thinking that the
	remote host is down or in some other way unresponsive.

	Under the current fallback mode, this ends up printing the erro
	messages from local preprocessing twice, once while its trying to
	preprocess the file to send it to the server, and once while trying to
	compile locally. I think that's ok.

	Further enviroment variables for controlling behavior of include server
	when invoked through pump.

	Also, we fixed the problem that for the common situation that configure
	is run in the top level directory of the source tree it was impossible
	to run 'pump'.

	The solution is to regard the script alteration by the Makefile rule for
	'pump' something that regards mainly the installed version. The source
	tree version of pump finds its Python files in the source directory and
	its .so file under the 'build/lib.xxx/include_server' subdirectory of th
	scr directory.

	Finally, we took out the hardcoding for values of the potential distcc
	servers.  When the make rule for 'pump' is run, the environment variable
	DISTCC_POTENTIAL_HOSTS with its current value is copied into 'pump' --
	if it is set.

	So, now I prepare distribution by doing:

	    DISTCC_POTENTIAL_HOSTS="test-distcc1.ame test-distcc2.ame test-distcc3.ame test-distcc4.ame test-distcc5.ame pump1.ame pump2.ame pump3.ame pump4.ame pump5.ame pump6.ame pump7.ame pump8.ame pump9.ame distcc1" make pump

	This also of course makes the 'pump' script work in the source
	directory, where it'll now pick up the servers I specified for the ad
	hoc and regression tests I run.

	With this machinery, I was again able to easily test the other pending
	changelists for the include server.

	We fix several bugs in the include server.

	- The macro evaluator has been completely rewritten. In particular, it
	  can now be used to parse files in maps/frontend that involve computed
	  includes like:

	    #include MAPS_TEMPLATE_VARNAMES(map_kml_results)

	- We also now parse macro calls on arguments that contain macro calls.

	- We implement the 'disabled' semantics of macro invocation (for
	  infinite recursion prevention).

	- We now apply # and ## only as part of expanding function-like macros.

	- We added several new tests, in part taken from the CPP Internals
	  document.

	- A test for ResolveExpr with pedagodical value has been added (and
	  another file for this test to work).

	- The macro evaluator has been thouroughly commented.

	- The parser has been updated so that it no longer thinks that '//'
	  within a filepath is a C++ comment.

	Fix bugs with the generation of the "pump" script from "pump.in":
	  - $ was not properly escaped and was being interpreted
	    by Make rather than the shell
	  - the pump.in script that is being copied could be read-only
	    and we did not (a) remove the old read-only copy nor (b) make
	    the new copy writable.
	  - pump should be a real target, not a phony target
	  - we need a dependency "all: pump"

	P.S. After syncing this change, you need to run "autoconf" (or
	sync Manos' change which updated the configure script),
	"configure", and then "make".

2007/05/30 16:59:02  Craig Silverstein <opensource@google.com>

	Continuing cleanup of the code, mostly to get varnames to
	be consistent.  But also some functionality changes:

	1) Separated out the realpath_map into two data structures,
	   one that canonicalizes the paths, and the other that keeps
	   the systemdir-prefix information.  Both are now part of the
	   mondo-cache object.  There's still a bit more work to be
	   done to get the systemdir-prefix cache working intuitively.

	2) Added RelpathMapToIndex, which requires that its keys not
	   start with a /.  Use this new class for includepaths, so we
	   get better error checking; we'll now correctly fail when we
	   see code like #include </usr/local/string.h>, which we
	   can't handle properly.

	3) [smaller] We now fall back on the python equivalents if we
	   don't have the C-speedups for realpath and stat().

	4) [smaller] Modified the convenience functions to be per
	   data-type rather than per varialbe: we have SearchdirIndex
	   and CurrdirIndex rather than just DirectoryIndex.  (Since
	   this function is never used, it doesn't really matter,
	   but...)

	These were more syntactic cleanup:

	1) Use currdir everywhere to mean the current directory, to
	   match cache_basics.py.

	2) I started some comment changes to be more consistent.  For
	   instance, every time we had a realpath_map argument, I try
	   to say what a realpath_map is (in one line!) rather than
	   just say its type -- which is, admittedly, better than
	   nothing.  Only small work done here; still lots more.

	3) Some places are still using fp instead of includepath.
	   I've fixed up most, but for some I'm not sure that the fp
	   is an includepath exactly, so I'm waiting to clean those
	   up.

	4) Several places would pass a list in to a routine by
	   reference, so the procedure would fill the passed-in list
	   rather than returning a new list.  This can be more
	   efficient, but is harder to follow, especially in python
	   where pass-by-value is expected.  Change to a more natural
	   control-flow in situations where efficiency isn't critical.

	I also corrected the following deviations from the style
	guide:

	1) (Almost) no "naked" exceptions.  Before there was lots of
	   "try: os-operation except: die".  Now we actually check
	   that it's an IOError or an OSError.  We also now print out
	   the 'why' status as part of the error message.

	2) Got rid of unused imports.

	3) Made sure there was at least two spaces between code and
	   end-of-line comments.  Still more places to fix this one...

	4) Nixed trailing whitespace (at the end of each line).

	Update the output from "distcc --version".
	1. src/help.c: mention that it supports version 3 of the protocol,
	    i.e. distcc_pump
	2. configure.ac: change version to "distcc 2.18.3-13gg-pump1"
	    rather than "distcc 2.18.3", i.e. include both
	    a. "-13gg" to show it has all the existing Google patches, and
	    b. "-pump1" for the distcc_pump extensions that support
	        preprocessing on the server.
	3. configure: regenerate based on the new configure.ac.
	    This resulted in some slight differences due to different
	    autoconf versions, but they appear innocuous.

	TESTED=Ran make and manually verified the output of "distcc --version"
	       and "distccd --version".
	       Tried running "make maintainer-check"; that failed, but I think
	       the failures are unrelated to my change (probably they're due
	       to problems with the merge of distcc-pump with the Google distcc

2007/05/09 18:41:10  Manos Renieris <opensource@google.com>

	Distcc-pump first implementation.

	Various little changes, making functions from static into
	global, all around the code; a bug fix in argutil.c.

	Important changes are:
	- On the protocol, which is extended as "version 3", that
	  supports compression and also cpp on the server.
	  - distcc.h: Added the enum for where to do the cpp.
	  - hosts.c: Map a set of features (currently a subset of
		where to do cpp and whether to do compression) onto
		a protocol number.
	  - rpc.c:  The client sometimes sends either a file, or
	    a link to the server. The server needs to be able to
	    accept either, so dcc_r_sometoken_int allows some
	    alternation to the protocol.
	- Talking to the include server:
	  - compile.c: dcc_build_somewhere tries to talk to the
		include server, and pushes the information about
		the dotd file to dcc_compile_remote. This is where
		the fallback-to-the-original-protocol code lives.
	  - include_server_if.c: Talk to the include server.
	- The communication from client to server. The client needs to
	  send multiple files, and perhaps links, to the server; the
	  client also needs to sent its current working directory,
	  - remote.c: Entry points for sending multiple files to
	        the server.
	  - rpc.c: The server needs to handle not only files, but also
		links (directories are handled implicitly).
	  - clirpc.c: Added a function to send the current working
		directory.  Added a function, dcc_x_many_files. It sends
		multiple files to the server.  In addition, it changes
		the filenames to chop off the additions of the include
		server.
	  - serve.c: Added a function to receive the current working
		directory.
	- On the server side, the server receives multiple files,
	  and the working directory, builds a directory structure (which
	  it keeps of, to clean it up at the end)
	  - srvrpc.c:
	        Added a function, dcc_r_many_files, to receive multiple
		files.  In addition, it changes the filenames to put all
		the files under a "fake root" directory.
	  - serve.c: lots of work to set up "fake root" directories,
		chdir to the right place, produce a .d file, and
		absolutize include directives.
	  - tempfile.c: Creation of whole temp directories,
	        not just files.
	  - cleanup.c: Since we are receiving multiple files,
		we need to keep a dynamic list of what temporary
		files we create. It can now handle directories.
	- ".d" files: the client needs to find out where the dotd file
	        should go; the server needs to produce it, remove all
		references to the local filesystem (gcc can't do
		that from the outside) and send it back to the client.
	  - dotd.c: Most of the code that handles the dotd: figuring
		out if we need it, and where it should go; also,
		cleaning it up after it gets created on the server.
	  - clirpc.c Changed dcc_retrieve_results to retrieve
		the dotd file.

## More changes that were made internally to Google, and not integrated
## into the main distcc distribution until 2008.  These log messages
## are from the RPM spec file's changlog.

* Thu Jun 14 2007 Manos Renieris <opensource@google.com>
- Added all the distcc-pump related parts to distcc.spec.
- Changed the way the package is built.
- Remove source package generation.
- Man pages are now unzipped.

* Mon Feb 8 2007 Dongmin Zhang <opensource@google.com>
- Added hosts list option to lsdistcc, such that lsdistcc can check only the
  hosts listed on the given list. The host list is given in command line.

* Wed Jan 31 2007 Dongmin Zhang <opensource@google.com>
- Added _libdir definition in rpms.epc.
- Changed Name, Version, and Release to the ones passed by --define.
- Updated the server init script to give different path of ACL files for grhat
  and goobuntu as suggested by Arthur Hyun <opensource@google.com>.

* Mon Jan 22 2007 Dongmin Zhang <opensource@google.com>
- Fixed a bug in timeout patch. Added sigaction to catch SIGCHLD such that the
  select() in dcc_collect_child() could break out when the file is finished to
  compile.

* Fri Dec 1 2006 Ollie Wild <opensource@google.com>
- Removed the 01-distcc-gdb-20051210.patch patch.  The parser in this was too
  naive to deal with output generate with the -directives-only flag.  Also, it
  should no longer be needed with recent versions of gcc.
- Removed the 10-distcc-before-cpp_locking-sub-gdb.patch and
  12-distcc-after-cpp_locking-add-gdb.patch patches.  These were just modifying
  the former patch.

* Fri Sep 8 2006 Michael Moss <opensource@google.com>
- Update install and init scripts to work on Debian and Red Hat (allowing the
  .rpm to be converted to .deb with alien, and then installed on Debian).
  Some noteworthy changes:
  - Deb - Remove unused defaults file /etc/default/distcc.
  - Deb - No longer uses debconf.
  - RH  - useradd is run in post- rather than pre- install.
  - RH  - distcc server is automatically started.
- Added enable/disable commands to init scripts so the daemon can be
  "permanently" disabled on misbehaving hosts.
- Added patches to allow building LSB-compliant binaries.
- Reorganized some existing patches to better partition functionality.

* Tue Feb 28 2006 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- removed cache again

* Mon Feb 20 2006 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- added cache

* Mon Feb 6 2006 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- use Josh's randomize patch instead of Michael's,
  since Josh's seems to perform better in our tests
- added disk space statistic on http interface
- lsdistcc now has -x option to output info even on down hosts (will be useful for server side caching)

* Tue Jan 2 2006 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- removed load shedding patch (we have swap turned on, so overload isn't as bad)
- added stats for timeout

* Wed Dec 8 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- lsdistcc now has -l option, better -v output
- distccd now has nicer logging, --limit-load option, bugfixes in load shedding

* Tue Nov 22 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- rejects jobs if load too high
- serves up stats via http on port 3633
- lsdistcc now has new -p and -c0 options

* Wed Nov  2 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- updated lsdistcc to use the longer of the two of HOST and HOSTNAME
  to handle shells that set HOST to the nonqualified hostname,
  but HOSTNAME to the FQDN

* Thu Oct 13 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- updated lsdistcc patch
- removed gcc as a dependency, since we want to use it with
  a wide range of other compilers (and in our case, not the
  standard gcc), and it's impractical to list them all as dependencies

* Fri Sep 16 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- now reads /etc/distcc/hosts instead of /usr/etc/distcc/hosts
- replaced distcc-2.18.3-rhl.patch with distcc-2.18.3-stringmap.patch
  The stringmap patch updates the rhl init.d script to know about
  all installed crosstool toolchains, and enables fuzzy path matching
  This is useful if the toolchains are not installed at the same
  prefix on all systems
- removed distcc-domain.patch
- added distcc-2.18.3-lsdistcc.patch

* Sat Sep  3 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- now reads /etc/distcc/hosts instead of /usr/etc/distcc/hosts
- applied distcc-domain-2.patch

* Thu Jun 15 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- Updated to 2.18.3
- applied --randomize patch and cpp_locking patch
- redhat init.d script reads /etc/distccd.allow to construct --allow arguments
- added scriptlets from dag's package, but don't start service on install,
  and call it distcc rather than distccd (to match the current
  packaging's old practice)

    Revision:

    Don't call rs_fatal; instead return an error.  It was giving warnings on
    non-gcc compilers because it wasn't seen as noreturn, and anyhow aborting
    is a bit untidy.

    Summary:
      Always build conftest.c locally
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-137

    Problem: configure tests are typically very quick to build; also
    configure can be very sensitive to stderr warnings or other small
    variations between machines.

    Fix: To make things faster and safer, build conftest.* locally; also
    tmp.conftest.* used by ccache.

    * src/filename.c (dcc_source_needs_local): New function.

    * src/arg.c (dcc_scan_args): Check.

    Fix: In fact, we can probably do fine by just using plain IO to receive
    data.  This is already done for compressed data.

    * src/pump.c (dcc_r_bulk_plain): Remove.

    * src/pump.c (dcc_r_bulk): Just pump bytes through when receiving data;
      don't worry about mmap.  Doc.

    * src/bulk.c (dcc_r_file): Output files can be WRONLY if we're not using
      mmap.

    * src/io.c (dcc_want_mmap): Remove.

    * man/distcc.1, man/distccd.1: No more mmap!

    Summary:
      remove signal-based timeouts
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-127

    Problem: Using alarms to enforce timeouts is inherently unsafe, because
    it might leave e.g. the resolver or C library in an inconsistent state.

    Fix: Don't use signals.  We can do something simpler and safer using
    select() in a future commit.

    We no longer have a timeout on name resolution; the best fix for this is
    to set an appropriate timeout in resolv.conf.

    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-124

    Short 5s CONNECT timeout covers only name resolution and TCP
    connection.

    SEND phase and timeout should include sending the header, and waiting
    for cpp to complete.  60s to send.

    Allow up to 20mins for compilation.

    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-123

    Problem: Was using longjmp() from the SIGALRM handler to return an
    error.  This is not safe.

    Fix: Use siglongjmp() instead.  That may not be completely safe
    either, but it might fix the problem.

    Revision:

    Using a doubly-linked list to hold integers uses a lot of time and
    memory.  Instead we use just a simple circular array.

    Summary:
      dcc_r_bulk_lzo1x: fix nasty bug in mmap recv lzo
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-44

    When reading in compressed data, our initial buffer might not be large
    enough for the actual compressed data, so we need to free it and make
    a larger one.  When freeing the mmapped buffer, we need to pass both
    address and length of the mapping.

    The bug was that we increased the length before unmapping and
    therefore randomly unmapped some block of memory, causing a crash
    later on.

    Fix: don't increase the length until we're done with the old value.

    This code is really too complex to be safe.

    Summary:
      patch from joshh to randomize host list
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-21

    In http://lists.samba.org/archive/distcc/2004q2/002250.html, Dan
    proposed randomizing the hosts list.  Here's a patch to add that
    feature, controlled by a special --randomize option in the hosts list.
    On a large shared build cluster, this helps spread the load
    without requiring separate hosts lists for each user.
    Martin, what do you think?

## These changes are from before development was done under arch.

2004-04-10  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/mon-gnome.c (dcc_gnome_make_mainwin): Check gtk version and
	don't use gtk_window_set_icon_from_file before 2.2.0.  Reported by
	Dag Wieers.

2004-03-21  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/exec.c (dcc_critique_status): Log input filename.

	* src/clirpc.c (dcc_send_job): Log input filename,

	* src/remote.c (dcc_compile_remote): Log input filename.

	* src/serve.c (dcc_run_job): Log input filename.

	* src/compile.c (dcc_compile_local): Log input filename.

2004-03-03  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Quieten g_messages.

	* src/distcc.c (dcc_show_usage): Describe DISTCC_DIR and other
	things.

	* man/distcc.1: Document DISTCC_DIR and fix some spelling errors.
	Patch from Thomas Schwinge.

	* src/hosts.c (dcc_get_hostlist): Get hosts from
	$DISTCC_DIR/hosts, rather than hardcoding to ~/.distcc.

	* src/tempfile.c (dcc_get_top_dir): Make this public.  Just log a
	warning if $HOME is not set.

2004-03-02  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/srvnet.c (dcc_listen_by_addr): Don't create the socket, just
	listen() on it.
	(dcc_check_client): Do access control checks on ipv4-mapped or
	ipv4-compat IPv6 addresses.

	* src/srvnet.c (dcc_socket_listen) [ENABLE_RFC2553]: Try creating
	sockets in every returned address family until we get one that
	works.  Fix leak of addrinfo list.

	* src/srvnet.c (dcc_socket_listen) [!ENABLE_RFC2553]: Create
	socket here.

2004-03-01  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/cleanup.c (dcc_cleanup_tempfiles): If DISTCC_SAVE_TEMPS is
	set, then we still need to remove temp files from the list or it
	will overflow.

	* src/mon-gnome.c, src/mon.c: Don't include netutil.

	* src/dparent.c (dcc_standalone_server): Set defer-accept bit.

	* man/distccd.1: Document DISTCC_TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT.

	* src/netutil.c (dcc_defer_accept): New function.

2004-02-29  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* test/testdistcc.py (ScanArgs_Case): Test -Wa,-xarch=v8.

	* src/arg.c (dcc_scan_args): Allow "-Wa,-xarch=v8" to be remote.
	Reported by Ben Scarlet.

	* test/testdistcc.py (ScanArgs_Case): Add test cases for -x
	handling.

	* src/arg.c (dcc_scan_args): Handle invocations like "-xcpp" with
	no space after -x.  Suggested by Ben Scarlet.

	* test/testdistcc.py (CompressedCompile_Case): Add a test of
	compression.

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Include sys/loadavg.h if available.

	* configure.ac: Check for sys/loadavg.h.  Suggested by Dimitri
	Papadopoulos.

	* man/distcc.1: Document comments in host files.

	* test/testdistcc.py (ParseHostSpec_Case): Add test for
	"localhostbutnotreally".

	* src/hosts.c (dcc_parse_hosts): Fix matching of hosts with names
	like "localhost2".

2004-02-20  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/compress.c (dcc_r_bulk_lzo1x): ftruncate the file after
	munmapping, rather than before.  Might be better on HP-UX which
	has problems with IO on mapped files.

	* README.packaging: Update description of why packagers should
	change version numbers.

2004-02-19  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/netutil.c (dcc_sockaddr_to_string): Handle null sockaddr.

	* src/srvnet.c (dcc_check_client): Handle null sockaddr.

	* src/daemon.c (dcc_inetd_server): If there is no sockaddr, pass
	it as NULL.

	* src/netutil.c (dcc_sockaddr_to_string) [ENABLE_RFC2553]:
 	Failure to convert the address to a string should be just a
 	warning, not an error.  Add special cases for unix-domain sockets
 	and unknown address families.  Possibly fixes SSH connections with
 	ENABLE_RFC2553.

	* src/daemon.c (dcc_inetd_server): Downgrade warning on
	getpeername failure to just a notice message.

2004-02-19  Albert China  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* test/testdistcc.py: Get test suite working on most of the
	platforms we support:

	  1. Not much use in testing with the native compiler so we
	     *force* the test suite to use gcc.

	  2. Rather than picking up gcc from $PATH, we pass the full path
	     to GCC. This avoids problems when distccd is running.

	  3. I've added known failures on some platforms. For example, the
	     assembler test should only run on Linux x86. Where we know
	     the test will fail, we print:

	DashONoSpace_Case              NOTRUN, GCC mips-tfile wants space after -o
	...
	RemoteAssemble_Case            NOTRUN, Linux x86 only
	PreprocessAsm_Case             NOTRUN, Linux x86 only

	The tests pass on: HP-UX 10.20, 11.00, 11i; IRIX 6.5; Redhat Linux
	7.1, 9; Solaris 7, 8, 9; Tru64 UNIX 4.0d, 5.1

2004-02-18  Albert China  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	These patches were tested on: AIX 4.3.2, 5.1; HP-UX 10.20, 11.00,
	11i; IRIX 6.5; Redhat Linux 7.1, 9; Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, 8, 9;
	Tru64 UNIX 4.0D, 5.1:

	* src/exitcode.h: IBM C compiler doesn't like trailing commas
	after last enum constant.

	* src/clinet.c: Define h_errno for HP-UX 10.20.

	* src/distcc.h: Forward declaration of 'struct sockaddr' gives
	problems with IBM C compiler. And, it's not needed.

	* src/serve.c: Forgot to include <sys/socket.h> Needed on HP-UX
	10.20, 11.00, 11i.

	* src/types.h: Remove definition of socklen_t if unavailable. We
	not declare it correctly via autoconf.

	* configure.ac:
	a) Better detection for socklen_t. This code is taken from curl but
	we submitted it so we own the copyright. Feel free to use as you
	please.
	b) Existence of mmap() doesn't imply MAP_FAILED exists. So, test
	and define it if unavailable.
	c) Replace the AC_CHECK_FUNCS(connect) mess.

2004-01-30  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/hosts.c (dcc_parse_hosts): Fix problem where we accidentally
	detected localhost at end of string.

	* src/h_hosts.c (main): Fix up verbose mode.

	* test/testdistcc.py (ParseHostSpec_Case.runtest): Test parsing of
	comments in host specifications.

	* src/hosts.c (dcc_parse_hosts): Skip over hash comments in host
	specifications.

2004-01-11  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/srvnet.c (dcc_check_client): Take list of allowed addresses
	as a new parameter so that this file doesn't depend on opt.c.

	* src/h_sa2str.c: New test harness.

	* Makefile.in (h_sa2str): new test.

2004-01-09  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* configure.ac: Make --without-gnome, --without-gtk,
	--disable-profile all turn the relevant options off rather than
	on.

	* Makefile.in: Add man/distccmon-text.1, and clean up manpage
	handling.

	* man/distccmon-text.1: Fix some typos.

	* src/dopt.c (distccd_parse_options): Option arguments should be
	held in (const char *).

	* src/setuid.c (dcc_discard_root): Must setuid after setgid, not
	before.  Fix from Wayne Davison.

	* src/mon.c (dcc_mon_check_orphans): When checking if a process
	exists, accept EPERM as indicating it exists but isn't ours.  This
	allows watching the directory of a different user.  Reported by
	Ernst Bachmann.

2003-12-21  Shri Shrikumar <shri@urbyte.com>

	* man/distccmon-text.1: New manpage.

2003-12-15  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* man/distccd.1: Mention TMPDIR.

	* man/distcc.1: We don't use a subdirectory of TMPDIR anymore.

2003-11-28  Harold L Hunt II  <huntharo@msu.edu>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Add --with-docdir=PATH option to set
	install location for documents.  The default is the same as
	previously: ${datadir}/doc/distcc.

2003-11-28  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/distcc.h (dcc_sockaddr_storage): Different method for
	choosing the type for dcc_sockaddr_storage.  We now use a plain
	sockaddr unless RFC2553 was requested, in which case we use
	sockaddr_storage.  HAVE_SOCKADDR_STORAGE is only used as a check
	that the RFC2553 implementation is reasonable.

	* src/distcc.h (dcc_sockaddr_storage): Use a new type name for our
	replacement of sockaddr_storage, rather than calling it
	sockaddr_storage, to make it more clear that it's determined by
	autoconf.

	* src/prefork.c (dcc_preforked_child): Use dcc_sockaddr_storage.

	* src/dparent.c (dcc_forking_parent): Likewise.

	* src/daemon.c (dcc_inetd_server): Likewise.

2003-11-23  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/netutil.c (dcc_sockaddr_to_string) [ENABLE_RFC2553]: Include
	the port number in the returned string, as for !ENABLE_RFC2553.
	This looks a bit wierd for IPv6 but is legible and unambiguous at
	least for output.  Increase static buffer size.

	* src/clinet.c (dcc_connect_timed): Check SO_ERROR to see if the
	connection failed so that we can trap it at this point rather than
	waiting until we start doing IO.

	* src/distcc.h [ENABLE_RFC2553]: sockaddr_storage is required for
	RFC2553.

	* src/dparent.c (dcc_nofork_parent, dcc_forking_parent): Socket
	addresses should be stored on the stack in sockaddr_storage so
	that IPv6 addresses will fit.  We always have this type, or can
	simulate it.

	* src/prefork.c (dcc_preforked_child): Likewise.

	* src/srvnet.c (dcc_socket_listen) [ENABLE_RFC2553]: Don't prefer
	to listen on IPv4 addresses, just use whatever the operating
	system thinks is best.

	* INSTALL: Suggest using --with-gnome and --enable-rfc2553.

	* man/distccd.1: Add description of --log-level.

	* src/dopt.c: New --log-level option to accomodate people who only
	want to log errors.

	* src/trace.c, src/trace.h (rs_loglevel_from_name): New function.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Check pkg-config information for
	GNOME/GTK+ at configure time, not build time.  This is a bit
	quicker than running the script for every file we build, and means
	that PKG_CONFIG_PATH only needs to be set for configure.

	* src/lock.c: Doc.

2003-11-17  Lionel Sausin  <lionel.sausin@free.fr>

	* man/fr/distcc.1, man/fr/distccd.1: French translations of the
	manual pages.

2003-11-17  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* distcc.h: MAXPATHLEN is not defined on GNU/Hurd, so supply a
	reasonable default value of 4096.  Reported by Santiago Vila.

2003-11-17  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* sendfile.c: Documentation updates.

2003-11-17  Allan Saddi  <allan@saddi.com>

	* sendfile.c (sys_sendfile): BSD implementation of this function
	needs to return -1 when transmission fails with EAGAIN and no
	bytes were sent.

2003-11-17  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* setuid.c (dcc_discard_root): Wayne suggests calling
	setgid()/setuid() before doing setgroups().  setgroups() on Mac OS
	X Jaguar can't seem to handle setting to 0 groups, so just set it
	to the same as the regular group.

	  src/renderer.h, src/state.c, src/state.h, src/util.c, src/util.h,
	  src/where.c: Merge the new GNOME monitor back from
	  'branch-pretty':

	  * GNOME monitor now uses a custom GtkCellRenderer subclass
	  (renderer.c, renderer.h) to draw a scarf-style history of the
	  states   for the slot.

	  * Now uses binary state files that are quicker to write out and
	  read	 in.  Not compatible with monitors from the previous
	  version.

	  * Structure renamed from dcc_mon_list to dcc_history.  Text
	  fields are   held directly in the structure to allow it to be
	  directly written   out.

	  * State files are written and rewritten in place, rather than
	  always   being renamed into place.  We cope reasonably gracefully
	  when	 reading back files that are truncated.

	  * New strlcpy() utility.

	  * Clean up cruft in dcc_lock_one() from when we had transmission
	  lock	 files.

	  * Better handling of EXEEXT to allow tab completion to work in
	  Makefiles.

	  * GNOME monitor is now constructed using libglade-2, rather than
	  the	hard way.

	  * New --enable-profile option for gprof.

	  * Depends on libglade, pango, libgnome, libgnomeui, at least if
	  you	want the graphical monitor.

	  * Change UNUSED() macro to make sure the variable is not
	  accidentally	 used.

	  * Rename state tags to consistent DCC_STATE_*

	* Makefile.in, gnome/distccmon-gnome.glade, src/mon-gnome.c,

	    I think the immediately previous approach of having the monitor
	  keep
	    track of state history and draw an unlabelled striped bar is
	    probably pretty good.  However, I'd like to also rely on the
	  regular
	    table widget to give us space to draw it.

	    This code builds and gives an empty table.	The renderer is
	  here but
	    disabled.

2003-09-18 14:14  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

2003-09-17 17:24  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Accumulate all task lists in a GSList
	  (currently never truncated)	and draw striped bars showing past
	  tasks.  Currently they are not   placed on the right row, so the
	  stripes are all pushed up towards   the top.

2003-09-17 16:10  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: mon-gnome.c, state.c, state.h: Rework monitor yet again:
	  :-/

	  * State files no longer hold a history of that process's state,
	  just	 its current information, and they are removed when the
	  process   exits.

	    This means that we cannot get very fine-grained plots of
	  transitions
	    between states, but it seemed to be hard to get that
	  information
	    displayed smoothly without burning a lot of CPU.  In addition,
	  we
	    were getting hundreds of leftover state files, which slow down
	    traversing the directory and are not really necessary.

	    I'll try instead putting the burden of remembering and painting
	    history onto the monitor, since it's the only program that
	  really
	    needs that information.

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Start adding a custom renderer.  Doesn't do
	  anything yet.

2003-09-11 18:57  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: As an experiment, draw pixbufs into the task

	  seems to be working OK.

	* gnome/distccmon-gnome.glade, src/mon-gnome.c: Move back towards
	  using a table, but now with space for our own   GtkCellRenderer
	  to draw a chart for each host slot.  At the moment   nothing is

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Draw tasks from a faked up list, rather than
	  just drawing arbitrary   rectangles.

	  * Redraw window using gtk_widget_queue_draw rather than Gdk.
	  This	 seems to fix a problem with redraw.  Perhaps we were
	  passing the	wrong rectangle.

2003-09-11 15:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Set bar height from font height.

	  Now when you change the GNOME system font, all the bars redraw to

2003-09-10 22:51  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

2003-09-10 22:48  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	  How cool!

2003-09-10 15:27  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* gnome/distccmon-gnome.glade: Put the chart drawing into a
	  GtkAlignment so that we can get a 6px   border around it.  It was
	  looking a bit cramped against the window border.

2003-09-10 15:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Allocate GCs for all states.

2003-09-10 14:32  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Stub for on_chart_drawing_expose().

2003-09-10 14:19  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* gnome/distccmon-gnome.glade, src/mon-gnome.c: Rework again:

	  * Start adding a 'key' window showing all the state colors.

	  * Go back to a DrawingArea for showing the chart (just
	  experimental).

	  * Delete table view from monitor.

2003-09-09 18:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/state.h: States must be listed in the order in which
	  they're run.

2003-09-09 18:15  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Update every 150ms.

	  * Don't update the table.

	  * Don't include DONE tasks.

	  * Left-align filename.

	  * Don't outline tasks.

	  * Reorder color list for new state enum.

	  * Make sure all states are drawn properly.

	  This is leaking memory badly!

2003-09-09 17:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/compile.c: Record input filename as soon as it is known.

2003-09-09 17:53  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Draw compilation tasks as striated rectangles.

2003-09-08 16:12  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: state.c, state.h, mon-text.c: Put state names into a new

	* src/mon.c: Processes that have exited can still be returned.

2003-09-08 16:01  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon.c: Now that we're storing client history, it's OK to
	  return information   about processes that have already exited.
	  We just need to make sure   that their state gets set to
	  DCC_STATE_DONE.

2003-09-08 15:59  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	  src/mon.c, src/mon.h, src/remote.c, src/state.c, src/state.h,
	  src/where.c: Many changes to the representation of the client
	  state to make it easier to draw a history.

	  * State is now stored as a natively encoded struct in a disk
	  file,   rather than using our network protocol.  This is slightly
	  faster,   makes it easier to store multiple fields, and avoids
	  tangling up the   state file handling (which ought to ignore
	  errors) with network IO.

	  * States can now be written and read with one atomic IO, and we
	  don't   use temporary files.

	  * States are represented by integers not strings.

	  * There is space in the state file for a history of times that it
	    entered particular states.

	* src/: daemon.h, dparent.c, dsignal.c, prefork.c, serve.c, util.c:
	  Rework some daemon signal handling designs to better suit a
	  preforking server.

	   * Daemon now runs in a single process group in all modes.

	   * Use signal() rather than sigaction() for simplicity.

	   * Killing the daemon kills all running children.  This is more
	     consistent with other daemons like Apache.  Any clients ought
	  to
	     fall back to local compilation, as they will have to do
	  anyhow.
	     Daemon is killed by reraising the signal, rather than exiting.

	   * Print a message when terminated by a signal that fits better
	  with
	     the strsignal() output.

	   * When terminated, explicitly run cleanups rather than relying
	  on
	     exit().

	   * Accepted children are not run in a separate group, because
	  this
	     will not work for preforked jobs.

	* src/distcc.c: For ssh support, we need to allow for separate
	  fds writing to and   reading from the network, because our
	  connection to the ssh client	 may be over pipes, which are

	    Therefore split them out into separate fds in the code.

2003-03-27 11:39  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Allow for implementations of 'install' that can

	* src/dparent.c: Fix small signal handling race that would
	  occasionally cause distccd   not to exit when signalled.  Pointed
	  out by Vance Lankhaar, solution   advice from Andrew Tridgell.

	    The problem was that a signal could arrive after we checked the
	    global indicator, but before entering accept().  So the daemon
	  would
	    need to wait for the accept to complete before it could respond
	  to
	    the signal.

	    Since the daemon only needs to do very simple cleanup, we now
	  simply
	    do it in line in the signal handler and never return.

2003-03-12 18:56  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

2003-01-12 23:24  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, NEWS:	 * Remove Plucker file: nobody seems to be
	  downloading it, and it's
		easy enough for people to build if they're interested.

2003-01-12 23:09  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* bench/Summary.py: Store results into Summary in the order in
	  which they are generated.

	  built from a subdirectory   of their unpacked directory.  In

	* bench/benchmark, NEWS: New macro-benchmark and test suite for
	  distcc.

	  This is the start of a script that runs distcc to build various
	  open source programs, as an overall test of correctness, and to
	  measure performance of a distcc installation.

	  It relies on the user to install and configure distcc servers and
	  clients, but handles the work of downloading, preparing, and
	  building packages by itself.

	  * benchmark: New file.

	* src/distcc.c: On the client, we should take locks only when

2002-11-08 18:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/exec.c: Do not take a lock on localhost when spawning
	  commands.

	  This is intended to get rid of a race condition that will
	  sometimes deadlock the client:

	    Two clients, P1 and P2, are both trying to compile on remote
	  machine
	    R.	Therefore, they both need to get a lock on localhost to run
	  cpp,
	    and on R.  If they acquire the locks in the opposite order,
	  then
	    they will block holding locks, and deadlock.  The ordering is
	    indeterminate because the cpp lock is acquired from the
	  separate
	    process forked to run cpp.

	  This was not evident in 0.12 and earlier because there was no
	  limit on the number of locks that could be taken.

	  On the server side, there are better places to regulate process
	  load than here.  We should instead hold off on accepting
	  connections until we have space to handle them.

	  On the client, we should take locks only when compiling locally.
	  cpp is cheap enough that it doesn't really need to be taken into
	  account.

	* src/distcc.c, src/dparent.c, src/exec.c, src/serve.c,
	  src/where.c, NEWS:	 * Remove support for feeding the compiler
	  from a fifo.	The gain from
		using fifos does not seem to justify the maintenance
	  burden.  (Martin Pool)

		 - This makes the behaviour more consistent, because some
	  platforms
		   (Cygwin) or filesystems (NFS, strangely) can't use
	  fifos.  It removes
		   a code path and a slightly complex autodetection.

		 - Using fifos makes some potential scheduling improvements
	  hard: the
		   server can't make good decisions about how many tasks to
	  run, because
		   each one will only use a fraction of the CPU.  The
	  client cannot
		   serialize file transmission, which would probably be
	  desirable.

		 - Using fifos makes reliably handling compiler failures
	  slightly
		   harder: the compiler may crash or exit at any time,
	  which will in
		   turn cause the server to hang if it later tries to open
	  or write to
		   the fifo.  In previous versions, distcc tried to handle
	  this by
		   catching SIGCHLD when the child terminated, and aborting
	  the
		   operation, but I am not sure that the method is
	  completely reliable.

	      * Use return codes more consistently

	      * Change log levels slightly to try to make sure nothing is
		emitted for successful compilation or even only compiler
		errors.

	      * Detached daemon now ignores hangup signal.

	      * Follow Unix convention of returning 128+SIGNAL if the
	  compiler exits
		with a signal.	(Martin Pool)

	      * Write server error messages to a log file and send them
	  back to
		the client on completion.

2002-09-01 07:52  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: tempfile.h, distcc.h: Split out tempfile.c routines into
	  their own header

2002-09-01 07:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/bulk.c: Doc.

	  dcc_r_file:

	   * Unlink the name before starting to receive the file.  This may
	     prevent bugs where the name already existed as a fifo.  The
	  old
	     code would have opened the fifo rather than replacing it, and
	     therefore would hang.  Afterwards, create with O_EXCL.

	   * Check that the file is successfully closed.  (Might catch
	  ENOSPC or similar.)

	  dcc_r_fd: Fix return code to be the result of transferring the
	  contents of the file.

2002-09-01 07:40  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/io.c: dcc_close: make return code consistent (EXIT_IO_ERROR,
	  not errno)

2002-09-01 07:39  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/exitcode.h: Add EXIT_IO_ERROR

2002-09-01 07:37  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/io.c: Cleanup sendfile code somewhat.

2002-08-31 13:48  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, linuxdoc/distcc.sgml, src/distcc.c, src/io.c,
	  src/tempfile.c, src/util.c, src/util.h: dcc_getenv_bool: Add
	  parameter giving default value so that things can default to
	  either on or off.

	  Add new environment variable for client and server,
	  DISTCC_TCP_CORK.  Defaults to on, intended mostly for performance
	  comparison or debugging.

2002-08-31 13:44  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/rpc.c: Fix prototype

	  Use dcc_x_token_int in one case I missed before

2002-08-31 12:41  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, src/bulk.c, src/distcc.c, src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h: Write
	  token/parameters using a single write() call.  May be very
	  slightly more efficient in CPU and perhaps packets.

	* NEWS, src/io.c:  Handle the case of sendfile() transmitting only
	  part of the supplied
	   data, similarly to a short write on a socket.  This doesn't
	  often
	   happen, but can occur if a ptrace debugger attaches while
	  sendfile is
	   running.

2002-08-29 10:35  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	  sometimes tripping over each other.

	  Fix damage to assembly cases from previous commit

	  Doc

	  Remove some dead code

2002-08-29 09:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Create the pid file from the parent process, so
	  that we can be sure that it exists before the parent exits.

2002-08-29 09:24  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Turn on signal handlers in parent.  Why were they

	* src/Makefile.in: Remove 'check' target because it must be run
	  from the parent

2002-08-26 09:37  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Notes about Cygwin and LNX-BBC volunteers

	  warning message.

2002-08-15 12:24  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/distcc.c: Only emit the "running locally" notice when the job
	  ought to be distributed but is not.  So having the host set to be
	  local, or non-distributable arguments just silently works.

2002-08-15 12:10  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

2002-08-10 15:04  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/trace.c: rs_format_msg: put the function name before the

	  this seems more readable.

2002-08-10 15:01  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: util.c, util.h: dcc_getenv_bool(): new function to make

	* src/exec.c: Remove old message

2002-08-02 14:56  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	  to compile.

2002-08-02 14:43  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* test/testdistcc.py: Run daemon on port 42000 for testing.

	  Check that compiling an invalid file produces no output file.

	  Use absolute path for pid file so that it's not confused by
	  changing directories.

2002-08-02 14:28  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: host:port syntax now supported.

2002-08-02 14:23  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: distcc.c, distcc.h, dparent.c, exec.c, hosts.c, hosts.h,
	  serve.c, where.c: Move towards using passing around dcc_hostdef
	  structures, rather than just hostnames, so that we can start
	  supporting nonstandard ports and eventually ssh.

2002-08-02 14:20  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/filename.c: Use strrchr() rather than rindex(): they ought to

2002-08-02 11:56  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, dopt.c, opt.h: Add --log-stderr option, intended
	  mainly for testing/debugging

2002-08-02 11:39  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore *.tmp

2002-08-02 11:36  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* test/testdistcc.py: Run all test cases within their own scratch
	  directory.

2002-08-01 23:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/serve.c: Add the ability to use either a fifo or a regular
	  temporary file for input to the compiler, controlled by --no-fifo
	  or failure to create the fifo.

2002-08-01 23:39  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, dparent.c, serve.c: dcc_accept_job: return
	  standard exit code

2002-08-01 23:34  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, dparent.c, io.c, io.h: Explicitly close the
	  socket before exiting, so that we have a better chance of
	  catching network transmission errors.

2002-08-01 23:20  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, src/dopt.c, src/opt.h: Add --no-fifo option.  Doesn't do
	  anything yet.

2002-08-01 23:19  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Fix cvsplot target.

2002-08-01 23:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Doc

2002-08-01 23:12  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* contrib/distcc.sh: This file, contributed by Dimitri
	  PAPADOPOULOS-ORFANOS <papadopo@shfj.cea.fr> may be installed as
	  "cc" somewhere on your $PATH ahead of the real gcc.  That allows
	  you to just use regular Makefiles without modifying them to
	  change hardcoded calls to cc.

	  This script will be a bit slow because of the overhead of running
	  things through a shell.  In a future release, this function
	  should be supported directly by distcc, which should be a bit
	  faster.

2002-08-01 23:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Define WAIT_ANY if it is missing, as seems to be
	  the case on Cygwin.

2002-08-01 22:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/exec.c: Doc.

2002-08-01 22:07  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/serve.c: Cygwin needs <signal.h> not <sys/signal.h>

2002-08-01 21:44  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/exec.c: Cope without WCOREDUMP, which is missing on Cygwin.

2002-08-01 21:34  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, configure, configure.ac, src/config.h.in, src/distcc.h: If
	  sa_family_t is missing, try just defining it as int.	Might help
	  Cygwin.

2002-08-01 21:16  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/where.c: Try using fcntl locks in addition to lockf and
	  flock.  Perhaps this will fix Cygwin.  Thanks to Marco Alanen.

2002-08-01 17:41  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, dopt.c, opt.h: Make errors from command-line
	  options go to stderr.

2002-08-01 17:14  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Always build check programs before running checks,
	  even with -j.

	  Specify complete PATH to binaries when running tests, so that
	  they can change into subdirectories.

2002-07-25 17:14  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Remove file that's no longer in CVS from distro.

2002-07-25 17:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* doc/results.txt: Add results file; not much here yet.

2002-07-25 16:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Add a somewhat-hacky "make dist" target to build a
	  tarball.

	  Compared to just "cvs export", this means we get to include built
	  versions of the documents, which is nice for people who can't
	  easily get the Linuxdoc SGML tools to work.  It does make the
	  binary bigger because there are so many formats, though.

	  Also, we omit things that end users might not want, such as the
	  Latte web site source.  People can get it from CVS (or rsync) if

	* configure, configure.ac: Bump version

2002-07-24 19:03  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* test/testdistcc.py: Clear the environment before running the

	  environment.

2002-07-24 19:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Change the semantics for detaching a little bit:
	  we now do it once the socket is listening.  This is rather more
	  useful for the test suite, because the suite now knows for sure
	  that when the parent exits, it can go ahead and try to connect.

2002-07-24 18:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* DEPENDENCIES, Makefile.in: Test case now requires python 2.2 for

	* test/testdistcc.py: Start adding to the test framework a way for
	  test cases to provide their own explanation of why they failed.
	  In particular, for ones that run shell commands, dump out all the
	  commands that were run, and their output.

2002-07-12 11:33  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/distcc.c: Give a proper error message for "distcc --fubar",
	  even when we would have chosen to run the command locally.

2002-07-12 11:32  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: If stdin is neither a socket nor a tty assume

	  client.

2002-07-10 15:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, src/arg.c, src/distcc.h, src/filename.c:  distcc will now
	  distribute jobs which use -s to compile but not
	   assemble. Previously they were always run locally, but there's
	  no
	   strong reason why they must be.  Unfortunately you need to
	  upgrade
	   both the client and server for this to work, because old servers
	  will
	   refuse to run gcc with -s.

2002-07-10 14:07  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dopt.c: distccd_show_usage: Document new options

2002-07-08 17:16  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: dcc_scan_args: -M causes the preprocessor to produce a list
	  of make-style dependencies on header files, either to stdout or
	  to a local file.  It implies -E, so only the preprocessor is run,
	  not the compiler.  There would be no point trying to distribute
	  it even if we could.

2002-07-08 17:13  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c, linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Change --inetd and --daemon

	  respectively

2002-07-08 16:46  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: dcc_scan_args: -M causes the preprocessor to produce a

	  Apparently Valgrind doesn't like using strchr(s, 0) to find the

2002-06-09 02:40  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: Add missing file

2002-06-09 02:38  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac: Bump version to 0.4 Get rid of old test scripts Add
	  new Makefiles

2002-06-09 02:34  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Doc.

2002-06-09 02:32  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dopt.c: Hide --tasks from help since it does nothing.

2002-06-09 02:09  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Add section on SMP.

2002-06-09 02:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Doc.

2002-06-09 01:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* ChangeLog, contrib/ChangeLog, linuxdoc/ChangeLog,
	  patches/ChangeLog, src/ChangeLog: update changelog

2002-06-09 01:50  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Factor out code to collect children.  Keep track
	  of how many are running.

2002-06-09 01:44  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, dparent.c: Change server to a more traditional
	  Unix	model of forking after accepting -- possibly less
	  efficient, but I was having trouble managing an orderly shutdown
	  of all children and this is simpler.

2002-06-09 01:43  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/Makefile.in: Run autoconf

2002-06-09 01:42  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Doc

2002-06-09 00:23  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: .S and .s probably works now.

2002-06-09 00:21  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: arg.c, distcc.h, serve.c: Correctly infer preprocessed
	  filename from source filename.  So for example if we're
	  processing a .S file, then we need to call the tmpfile .s so that
	  the compiler driver understands that it should just run the
	  assembler.

2002-06-09 00:08  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Note that network errors will not be
	  detected.

2002-06-09 00:05  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dopt.c: Doc.

2002-06-09 00:03  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: Server should log input and output filename too.

2002-06-08 23:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: arg.c: Log input and output filename.

2002-06-08 23:45  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Daemon parent tries to close listen_fd after
	  forking children, because it's no longer required.

2002-06-08 23:43  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: Makefile.am, daemon.c, distcc.h, dparent.c: Split
	  daemon-standalone-parent code into a separate file.

2002-06-08 23:35  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: Lots of doc updates.

2002-06-08 23:30  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: Update docs.

2002-06-08 23:24  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Note --pid-file.

2002-06-08 23:10  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: Add log message for stdin being a socket

2002-06-08 23:09  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/srvnet.c: open_socket_in: check that port number is
	  reasonable

2002-06-08 22:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/: .cvsignore, Makefile: Fix Plucker filename

2002-06-08 22:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/.cvsignore: Add Plucker-ized manual

2002-06-08 22:48  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/Makefile: Better name for Plucker file.

2002-06-08 22:40  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: Consistently call dcc_exit().

	  Notice immediately when one of our children dies, and reap all of
	  them.

	  When all children die or the parent is signalled, the parent
	  should kill the process group and itself.

2002-06-08 22:31  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/util.h: Fix function attributes.

2002-06-08 22:16  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/distcc.h: Clean up prototypes.

2002-06-08 22:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: Clean up exit codes.

	  If fork() fails, log an error, but keep trying.

	  Try to listen on socket before going into background, so that
	  failure is visible to the calling script.

2002-06-08 22:00  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/distcc.c: Detect invocations like "distcc -c"

2002-06-08 22:00  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/exitcode.h, linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Renumber exit codes so that
	  100 is a generic distcc failure.

2002-06-08 21:44  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dopt.c: Fix help message for --pid-file

2002-06-08 21:43  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, dopt.c, opt.h: Add --pid-file option to save
	  daemon's pid.

2002-06-08 21:42  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Update autoconf stuff

2002-06-08 14:24  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/Makefile: Don't build Linuxdoc by default because many
	  machines won't have the tools.

2002-06-08 13:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dopt.c: Fix overzealous memory mistake.

2002-06-07 16:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* ChangeLog, doc/ChangeLog, linuxdoc/ChangeLog, man/ChangeLog,
	  src/ChangeLog: auto-update ChangeLog

2002-06-07 11:09  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* man/: .cvsignore, Makefile, distcc.1, distccd.1: Correction from
	  Juan F. Codagnone for Makefile -- should call groff, not man, to
	  transform manpages

	  Also, add a little stub distccd page.  Both need to be updated to
	  show just the basic information and refer to the manual for more
	  info.

2002-06-06 18:21  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Improve cross-compile section.

2002-06-06 17:52  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Update doc: test suite has now been
	  written.

2002-06-06 00:22  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, NEWS, configure, configure.ac, src/config.h.in,
	  src/daemon.c, src/distcc.h, src/dopt.c, src/exitcode.h,
	  src/opt.h: Improvements to demon:

	   - make daemon put itself into background when running alone

	   - daemon preforks children according to --tasks option, notes if
	  they
	     die, and kills them when terminated

	   - --port option to set listening port (currently not useful,
	  since
	     you can't set port on client)

2002-06-05 19:00  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dopt.c: Fix mostly-harmless leaks of poptContext.  Detected
	  by valgrind -- how cool!

2002-06-05 18:53  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, src/tempfile.c: Add support for TMPDIR.  Not tested.

2002-06-05 17:22  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: bulk.c, daemon.c, distcc.c, exec.c, where.c: Doc.

2002-06-02 15:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Test cvs

2002-06-02 14:28  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/Makefile, man/Makefile: Fix recursive make targets

2002-06-02 14:18  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/Makefile, man/Makefile: Fix recursive make targets

2002-06-02 14:10  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, linuxdoc/Makefile: automake

2002-06-02 14:09  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: Makefile.in, daemon.c, exitcode.h: Start using consistent
	  return codes across all programs.

2002-06-02 14:07  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* contrib/make-j: make-j script from Alexandre Oliva
	  <aoliva@redhat.com> for use with distcc

	  Tests which machines are up, and runs Make with concurrency set
	  appropriately.

2002-06-02 13:59  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: .cvsignore, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, arg.c, clinet.c,
	  daemon.c, distcc.c, exitcode.h, h_scanargs.c, help.c, serve.c,
	  srvnet.c, trace.c, trace.h, util.c, util.h, where.c: Many
	  changes:

	  Start using consistent return codes across all programs.

	  Add h_scanargs to allow pyunit to test argument analysis.

	  If -fprofile-args, -ftest-coverage or -x is seen in arguments,
	  run locally.

	  Handle "gcc -c -c hello.c"

	  Better help message.

	  Start handling .s files (doesn't work yet)

	  Fix insertion of program/pid into trace msgs.

2002-06-02 13:56  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure, configure.ac: FreeBSD installs its version of libpopt
	  into /usr/local/, but does not put that on the default library
	  and header path.  We used to add that path if building on *bsd*,
	  but bje points out that will break cross-compilation, and it's
	  kind of ugly anyhow.

2002-06-02 13:55  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Don't configure from autogen.sh

2002-06-02 13:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Also descend into linuxdoc, pyunit and
	  man directories.

2002-06-02 13:51  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: More documentation, especially about bugs.

2002-06-02 13:50  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, OLDNEWS: Roll over news.

2002-05-31 16:36  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure, configure.ac: Apparently FreeBSD needs sys/types.h
	  before netinet/in.h.	From Frerich Raabe.

2002-05-31 16:20  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Add distcc link.

2002-05-31 16:10  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/Makefile: Move to distcc.samba.org.

2002-05-31 16:09  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Manual is now current for 0.3

2002-05-31 16:08  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/footer.html: Fix distcc homepage link.

2002-05-30 08:31  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac: Documentation from ben

2002-05-29 14:35  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: More notes from recent discussions.

2002-05-29 14:21  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: Doc.

2002-05-28 23:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, linuxdoc/ChangeLog,
	  src/ChangeLog: Commit Makefile rule

2002-05-28 23:09  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.am: Need to distribute ChangeLogs across directories

2002-05-28 23:04  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* ChangeLog: Update ChangeLog from CVS

2002-05-28 23:00  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, src/Makefile.in: autoconf

2002-05-28 22:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: update autoconf

2002-05-28 22:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/NEWS: Moved to parent directory

2002-05-28 22:56  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Go ahead and release.

2002-05-28 22:38  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* aclocal.m4, configure, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Bump
	  version to 0.3.

	  Try to get "make dist" working.

2002-05-28 19:50  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, configure, src/Makefile.in: rerun autoconf

2002-05-28 19:32  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac: Suggestion from Frerich to fix check for *bsd*.

2002-05-28 15:38  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/.cvsignore: Ignore temp file.

2002-05-28 15:29  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* aclocal.m4, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	  src/t_version: Add another trivial test suggested by bje

2002-05-28 15:18  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, src/config.h.in,
	  src/help.c: Export gnu host triple in --version

2002-05-28 15:07  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.guess, config.sub, configure,
	  configure.ac, src/Makefile.in: Detect BSD, and add /usr/local/ to
	  the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

2002-05-28 14:31  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* aclocal.m4: Silly autoconf

2002-05-28 14:24  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* patches/: distc, distc++: Single files that call 'distcc gcc' --
	  possibly needed for Makefiles that assume the compiler is a
	  single word.	(Does this include libtool?)

2002-05-28 14:18  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: .cvsignore, Makefile.in, config.h.in: Check in extra
	  autoconf-generated files.

2002-05-28 14:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/timebuild: Very primitive script for timing tests.

2002-05-28 13:52  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: h_exten.c, h_issource.c: Additional fixes for
	  rs_program_name.

2002-05-28 13:48  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, src/serve.c: BSD needs
	  sys/signal.h.

2002-05-28 12:43  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* .cvsignore, COPYING.FDL, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4,
	  configure, install-sh, missing, mkinstalldirs: Keep a copy of
	  autotools files in CVS, to help people on machines with different
	  versions.  Bah, humbug!

2002-05-28 12:37  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* ChangeLog, doc/ChangeLog, linuxdoc/ChangeLog, man/ChangeLog:
	  Regenerate ChangeLogs

2002-05-28 12:28  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: ChangeLog, daemon.c, distcc.c, trace.c, trace.h: Clean up
	  rs_program_name shmozlle

2002-05-27 00:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/srvnet.c: Doc

2002-05-27 00:14  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac: Doc

2002-05-26 01:44  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* .cvsignore, src/.cvsignore: Ignore extra garbage

2002-05-26 01:38  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac: Need to also look in sys/types.h for in_port_t on
	  BSD.

2002-05-26 01:35  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: Good fix from Ian Reinhart Geiser for silly mistake in
	  dcc_set_file_extension that I think would show up in "gcc -c
	  hello.c".

2002-05-26 01:27  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, src/serve.c: Ignore SIGPIPE in daemon as well as client.

	  Thanks to Ben Elliston.

2002-05-26 01:21  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac, src/clinet.c, NEWS: Try to cope without in_port_t.

	  Thanks to Luke Gorrie.

2002-05-26 01:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, distcc.c, h_exten.c, h_issource.c, trace.c: Cope
	  without program_invocation_short_name, as some GNU libc/cc
	  combinations don't seem to have it (???)

2002-05-26 00:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/trace.c: Replace calls to strnlen with strlen, because it
	  will always be short enough and FreeBSD doesn't have strnlen

2002-05-26 00:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac, src/help.c: Ignore strange new automake variables,
	  just use PACKAGE and VERSION

2002-05-26 00:47  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Fix Ian's name.

2002-05-26 00:46  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: M-/ strikes again :-)

2002-05-26 00:42  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/io.c: If there are no corks on this computer, don't try to
	  use them.

2002-05-26 00:32  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac, src/arg.c, src/bulk.c, src/clinet.c, src/daemon.c,
	  src/distcc.c, src/exec.c, src/h_exten.c, src/h_issource.c,
	  src/io.c, src/rpc.c, src/serve.c, src/srvnet.c, src/tempfile.c,
	  src/util.c, src/where.c, NEWS: Test for sys/sendfile.h and
	  sendfile(), and if we don't have them use plain read/write
	  instead.

	  Remove unnecessary dependencies on sys/sendfile.h

2002-05-26 00:23  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Don't say "make all", because on some platforms you
	  might really need gmake.

2002-05-26 00:08  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Need to also run aclocal to install automake stuff.

	  Also need to run autoheader early on in the process, because
	  automake depends on finding config.h.in.

2002-05-26 00:04  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Note help with automake

2002-05-26 00:01  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Handle ChangeLog

2002-05-25 23:57  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/.cvsignore: More test cases

2002-05-25 23:55  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: Get rid of editing mistake.

	  _SOURCES is a magic name for automake, so don't use it for common
	  source.

	  Thanks to Frerich Raabe.

2002-05-25 23:50  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Add a script to do everything necessary to build from
	  CVS.	This is needed because automake requires a spliff to get
	  out of bed, and the generated files are shipped in tarballs but
	  not stored in CVS.

2002-05-25 23:47  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac: Fix shell syntax: square brackets can't be used in
	  configure.ac because they clash with m4.

2002-05-25 19:23  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: Makefile.am, h_issource.c, t_issource: Add another test

2002-05-25 19:23  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac: chmod test files

2002-05-25 18:57  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: arg.c, distcc.c, distcc.h: Recognize the .ii extension that
	  ccache uses for preprocessed C++ code.  (Ian Reinhart Geiser)

2002-05-25 18:55  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS:     * Convert to using GNU automake and autoconf, so that
	  distcc can
		better handle portability, distribution and testing.
	  (Martin
		Pool)

	      * Start adding some "make check" tests. (Martin Pool)

2002-05-25 18:51  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: Recognize the .ii extension that ccache uses for
	  preprocessed C++ code.

2002-05-25 18:50  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: .cvsignore, Makefile.am, arg.c, distcc.h, h_exten.c,
	  t_exten: Add a test harness and script to test the simplest
	  function we have -- finding the extension of a filename.

2002-05-25 18:34  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/GNUmakefile: This Makefile is no longer needed because we
	  have automake.

2002-05-25 18:33  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* .cvsignore, src/.cvsignore: Ignore automake-generated files

2002-05-25 16:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/help.c, src/trace.c: More
	  automake integration fixes.  Builds properly now.

2002-05-25 15:47  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* .cvsignore, AUTHORS, COPYING, INSTALL, Makefile, Makefile.am,
	  NEWS, OLDNEWS, configure.ac, src/.cvsignore, src/Makefile.am:
	  Convert to automake.	Don't know if it works yet.

2002-05-24 16:45  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Add GNU FDL stuff.

2002-05-24 15:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>
